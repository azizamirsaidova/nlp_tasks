paolo emilio taviani ( <integer> november <year> – <integer> june <year> ) was an italian political leader , economist and historian of the career of christopher columbus . he was a partisan leader in liguria , a gold medal of the resistance , then a member of the consulta ( national assembly gathered to direct the transformation of the monarchy into a republic ) and the constituent council , later of the italian parliament from <year> until his death . several times minister in the republic ’ s governments . he was author of studies on economics and important works on christopher columbus , university professor and journalist . “ eminent political and government figure who for decades continued to bear witness to the diversity of ideals that inspired the resistance ” ( giorgio napolitano , president of the republic of italy ) . == biography == === early years ( 1912–1943 ) === taviani was born in genoa on november <days> , <year> . his mother , elide banchelli , was an elementary school teacher . his father , ferdinando , was a headmaster and one of the founders of the genoese section of the italian people 's party ( <year> ) . after graduating from the classical “ liceo ” , taviani went on to university where he earned a law degree in <year> . the same year he obtained his journalist ’ s license and began working for various catholic oriented newspapers . in <year> he obtained a second degree in social sciences from the prestigious scuola normale superiore of pisa ( collegio mussolini i.e . present day sant'anna school of advanced studies ) and in <year> he earned a third degree in letters and philosophy from the catholic university of milan . the next year he was professor of history and philosophy in the public “ licei ” as well as assistant lecturer in geography at the university of genoa . from <year> he was professor of demographics in the faculty of law in genoa . === resistance ( 1943–1945 ) === already in secondary school taviani joined the catholic group that was most sensitive to social issues . at university he became head of the genoese branch of fuci ( federazione universitaria dei cattolici italiani ) . following the lateran pacts , taviani , a young man at the time , shared in the illusion that fascism might one day evolve into a movement for social justice inspired by catholic values . consequently , at the age of <integer> he joined the pnf . but the fascists ’ belligerent policies and , above all , the racial laws of <year> shattered that illusion . by the eve of the war , taviani was firmly in the camp of the anti-fascists . on july <days> , <year> just before the fall of the regime , taviani founded in liguria the section of the “ partito-cristiano-sociale democratico ” ( later christian democracy , dc ) bringing together young people from the christian social movement with the older members of the people 's party . immediately after september <days> ( under the pseudonym of riccardo pittaluga ) taviani founded the committee for national liberation in liguria ( clnl ) as representative of the christian democracy . his clandestine activities often brought him among the partisans in the mountains ( it was in these years that he became close friends with the commanders aldo gastaldi , “ bisagno ” and aurelio ferrando , “ scrivia ” ) . taviani maintained contacts with allied military missions that had parachuted behind enemy lines . he was also editor of la voce d ’ italia a banned periodical published by the resistance in liguria . within the clnl taviani often argued the need for a single military command that could effectively coordinate the efforts of volunteers from so many different political backgrounds . on the night of april <days> , <year> the clnl assumed the leadership of the insurrection in genoa . on the evening of april <days> the german commander surrendered to representatives of the clnl . the next morning it was taviani who announced that the city had been liberated in a radio address broadcast by the bbc : “ genoa is free . people of genoa , rejoice ! for the first time in the history of this war a military unit has surrendered to the spontaneous forces of a people : the people of genoa ! ” for his activity in the resistance taviani would later receive the gold medal for merit in war in italy , gold medals for merit in the united states and the soviet union , the title of grand official of the légion d ’ honneur in france . taviani wrote about the resistance in the breve storia dell ’ insurrezione di genova , in the collection of short stories pittaluga racconta as well as in dozens of articles . his early years in the resistance marked taviani ’ s entire political career . from <year> he was president of italian federation of volunteers for freedom ( fivl ) . in <year> he was appointed president of the historical museum of the liberation of rome “ via tasso ” . later , on april <days> , <year> he gave a passionate speech in defence of the values of the resistance during a large demonstration which was strongly opposed by supporters of the centre-right coalition . in <year> taviani celebrated the first memorial day in italy remembering the mass extermination of jews at the “ via tasso ” museum . === from the post-war years to government ( 1945–1975 ) === immediately after the war taviani became involved in the task of transforming the monarchy into a republic . appointed to the consulta he was later elected to the constituent council where he drafted the articles regarding property in the constitution of the italian republic ( arts . <other> in the final text ) . in the elections from <year> to <year> taviani always managed to obtain the most votes among the deputies elected from liguria . from <year> to <year> he was first vice-secretary , then national political secretary of the christian democratic party . in the party he always supported the secular basis that de gasperi had wanted . in <year> taviani was head of the italian delegation in paris for the schumann plan , the first major step towards a united europe.undersecretary to de gasperi at the ministry of foreign affairs ( <year> ) , later minister for foreign trade ( <year> ) , then again minister of defence ( from <year> to <year> ) , taviani supported the choice to enter the atlantic alliance , though always from a pro-european perspective . he was one of the most stubborn supporters of the ecsc , the eec and finally the european union . as defence minister he favoured the re-entry of the federal republic of germany into the western alliance.from <year> until <year> taviani was minister in every one of italy ’ s governments . as minister of the interior he was active in the struggle against the mafia and effectively countered both the neo-fascists ( in <year> he outlawed the extreme right wing organisation ordine nuovo ) and the red brigades ( <days> september <year> were arrested the leaders of the organization r. curcio and a. franceschini ) . taviani managed to survive the “ death sentences ” imposed on him by the oas , the on and the br . === social christianity , support for nato and opening up to the left === in the eyes of conservatives taviani ’ s contribution to the italian constitution and his book la proprietà made him appear to be too close to socialist ideas . but during the first years of the cold war taviani was one of the firmest supporters of nato which he viewed as the only possible guarantee of italy ’ s security . this position drew criticism from socialists and communists . in the early 1960s taviani favoured an alliance between the christian democrats and the socialist party in the regional government of liguria which he later supported for years in national governments . in <year> he firmly refused to accept a proposal by italy ’ s president antonio segni to head an emergency government as an authoritarian crack down on the communists . in the years that followed taviani was severely criticised by supporters of the political right . after the coup d ’ état in chile , taviani recognised the change that took place in the italian communist party under enrico berlinguer . during his final period as minister of the interior he expressed appreciation of the aid the pci provided in countering illegal armed organisations ( both from the right and left wings ) . by the end of <year> taviani ’ s position within the christian democratic party had become difficult because many felt he was too far to the left . taviani refused offers to compromise and thereafter only accepted institutional appointments but never again took up a post in the government . === senator for life ( 1976–2001 ) === from <year> to <year> taviani was elected senator of the italian republic in liguria . from <year> he was president of the senate ’ s foreign affairs committee . in <year> he was appointed “ senator for life ” for “ social , literary and scholarly merit ” . after the dissolution of the christian democratic party taviani became a member of the new italian people 's party ( in the centre-left coalition ) . in one of his final interviews he expressed the hope that the ppi would join the european social democratic group . == ideology == === economics === taviani ’ s economic thought belongs to a current of christian socialism . his critical studies of marx , pareto , smith and ricardo were influenced by maritain , blondel and mounier . after an interest in his youth for corporativist theories , taviani developed the idea of a “ mixed ” economy , a “ third way ” which would be capable of promoting social justice while getting beyond the opposition between capitalism and socialism . an important event for taviani was his participation in the drafting of the codice di camaldoli , <integer> propositions that had been conceived to orient the activities of catholics in the social , economic and political spheres . of particular note among taviani ` s economic studies are problemi economici nei riformatori sociali del risorgimento italiano ; utilità , economia e morale ; il concetto di utilità nella teoria economica.taviani taught the history of economic doctrines at the university of genoa from <year> to <year> . from <year> to <year> taviani was editor of the journal civitas which dealt with topics related to economics , contemporary history and international politics . == personal life == === historian of christopher columbus === taviani ’ s first publications on christopher columbus date back to <year> . but it was in the second half of the 1970s that research on columbus absorbed a large part of his time . taviani has left approximately <integer> publications on christopher columbus ( these have been translated english , french , spanish , german , portuguese , hungarian , turkish , vietnamese , etc. ) . ) . there are two major works : christopher columbus . the grand design ( <year> , ing . ed . <year> ) and the voyages of columbus ( <year> , ing . ed . <year> ) . taviani wrote them by combining a study of primary and secondary sources with a direct geographic analysis of all the places columbus reached . taviani compared the various interpretations , pointed out those that were most reliable , provided some new insights and left the field open to further hypotheses whenever it was not possible to overcome any reasonable doubt . he dialogued with scholars from italy and abroad and managed to achieve a nearly unanimous consensus on a few firm points of historiography.from the second half of the 1980s taviani was president of the scientific committee for the `` nuova raccolta colombiana '' ( <integer> works by the most important scholars from italy and abroad ) and he also took part in organising celebrations marking the 500th anniversary of the columbus ’ discoveries in <year> . his definitive work on the subject appeared in <year> which summarised and updated all the previous works : christopher columbus ( three volumes published by the italian geographic society ) . === private life and last years === taviani moved to rome after the war and lived there for the rest of his life . for purposes of study , institutional postings or simply out of passion , from his youth taviani made countless trips , visiting every continent , especially the countries of latin america . still he always retained close ties to his native liguria . every year he spent long periods near bávari ( a suburb of genoa ) in his parents ’ modest country house . he was especially fond of the small mountain villages in the upper val trebbia where he had seen the resistance grow against the nazis and fascists . <days> january <year> taviani married vittoria festa whom he had met at the university of genoa : after more than sixty years of marriage they had eight children and twenty grandchildren . taviani appeared for the last time on the italian political stage on <integer> may <year> , when he presided as senior member of the senate ’ s inaugural session . a few days later he suffered a stroke and died in rome in the early morning of june <days> . his memoirs came out a few weeks later : politica a memoria d ’ uomo . he is buried in bávari . == bibliography == problemi economici nei riformatori sociali del risorgimento italiano ,

`` museum '' in his backyard . he also helped curate the auckland war memorial museum shell collection.dell studied at mount albert grammar school and later at the auckland university college . he took a teacher ’ s course at auckland teachers ' college , but world war ii delayed his plans to become a teacher . he joined the new zealand artillery , serving on nissan island , the solomon islands , southwest asia , egypt , and italy . he later published several papers on the land snails he had collected in the solomon islands.in <year> , he married botanist and schoolteacher miriam matthews , and they had four daughters together . his wife continued working after their marriage and became a well-known women 's advocate.after the war , dell was offered a job as malacologist at the dominion museum , where he started to standardise the cabinets and built up a collection of more than 30,000 specimens . in the meantime , he took a master 's degree in science at victoria university college , with a pioneering thesis on cephalopods , octopuses and squid.his breakthrough came with the chatham islands expedition of <year> . the results were published in <year> as the archibenthal mollusca of new zealand , which was a major contribution to the knowledge of molluscan fauna in the bathyal zone of new zealand waters . this publication earned him a doctorate in science in 1956.soon after , dell started to work on antarctic collections , with among others alan beu and winston ponder . in <year> , he published a major monograph on the antarctic bivalves , chitons and scaphopods.dell became first assistant director in <year> and later in <year> , director of the dominion museum , which would become the museum of new zealand te papa tongarewa . he retired in <year> , and started writing again . in <year> , he published his standard work antarctic mollusca with special reference to the fauna of the ross sea . dell published more than <integer> papers on mollusca ( marine ,

widely recognised as one of the most significant evolutionary theorists of the 20th century.hamilton became famous through his theoretical work expounding a rigorous genetic basis for the existence of altruism , an insight that was a key part of the development of the gene-centered view of evolution . he is considered one of the forerunners of sociobiology . hamilton also published important work on sex ratios and the evolution of sex . from <year> to his death in <year> , he was a royal society research professor at oxford university . == early life == hamilton was born in <year> in cairo , egypt , the second of seven children . his parents were from new zealand ; his father a. m. hamilton was an engineer , and his mother b. m. hamilton was a medical doctor . the hamilton family settled in kent . during the second world war , the young hamilton was evacuated to edinburgh . he had an interest in natural history from an early age and spent his spare time collecting butterflies and other insects . in <year> , he discovered e. b. ford 's new naturalist book butterflies , which introduced him to the principles of evolution by natural selection , genetics , and population genetics . he was educated at tonbridge school , where he was in smythe house . as a <other> , he was seriously injured while playing with explosives his father had that were left over from making hand grenades for the home guard during world war ii . hamilton had to have a thoracotomy and fingers on his right hand had to be amputated in king 's college hospital to save his life . he was left with scarring and needed six months to recover . before going up to the university of cambridge , he travelled in france and completed two years of national service . as an undergraduate at st. john 's college , he was uninspired by the `` many biologists [ who ] hardly seemed to believe in evolution '' . he was intrigued by ronald fisher 's book the genetical theory of natural selection , but fisher lacked standing at cambridge , being viewed as only a statistician . hamilton was excited by fisher 's chapters on eugenics . in earlier chapters , fisher provided a mathematical basis for the genetics of evolution and hamilton later blamed fisher 's book for his getting only a <other> degree . == hamilton 's rule == hamilton enrolled in an msc course in demography at the london school of economics ( lse ) , under norman carrier , who helped secure various grants for his studies . later , when his work became more mathematical and genetical , he had his supervision transferred to john hajnal of the lse and cedric smith of university college london ( ucl ) . both fisher and j . b. s. haldane had seen a problem in how organisms could increase the fitness of their own genes by aiding their close relatives , but not recognised its significance or properly formulated it . hamilton worked through several examples , and eventually realised that the number that kept falling out of his calculations was sewall wright 's coefficient of relationship . this became hamilton 's rule : in each behaviour-evoking situation , the individual assesses his neighbour 's fitness against his own according to the coefficients of relationship appropriate to the situation . algebraically , the rule posits that a costly action should be performed if : where c is the cost in fitness to the actor , r the genetic relatedness between the actor and the recipient , and b is the fitness benefit to the recipient . fitness costs and benefits are measured in fecundity . r is a number between <integer> and <integer> . his two <year> papers entitled the genetical evolution of social behaviour are now widely referenced.the proof and discussion of its consequences , however , involved detailed mathematics , and two reviewers passed over the paper . the third , john maynard smith , did not completely understand it either , but recognised its significance . having his work passed over later led to friction between hamilton and maynard smith , as hamilton thought smith had held his work back to claim credit for the idea ( during the review period maynard smith published a paper that referred briefly to similar ideas ) . the hamilton paper was printed in the journal of theoretical biology and , when first published , was largely ignored . recognition of its significance gradually increased to the point that it is now routinely cited in biology books . much of the discussion relates to the evolution of eusociality in insects of the order hymenoptera ( ants , bees and wasps ) based on their unusual haplodiploid sex-determination system . this system means that females are more closely related to their sisters than to their own ( potential ) offspring . thus , hamilton reasoned , a `` costly action '' would be better spent in helping to raise their sisters , rather than reproducing themselves . == spiteful behaviour == in his <year> paper selfish and spiteful behaviour in an evolutionary model hamilton considers the question of whether harm inflicted upon an organism must inevitably be a byproduct of adaptations for survival . what of possible cases where an organism is deliberately harming others without apparent benefit to the self ? such behaviour hamilton calls spiteful . it can be explained as the increase in the chance of an organism 's genetic alleles to be passed to the next generations by harming those that are less closely related than relationship by chance . spite , however , is unlikely ever to be elaborated into any complex forms of adaptation . targets of aggression are likely to act in revenge , and the majority of pairs of individuals ( assuming a panmictic species ) exhibit a roughly average level of genetic relatedness , making the selection of targets of spite problematic . == extraordinary sex ratios == between <year> and <year> hamilton was a lecturer at imperial college london . whilst there he published a paper in science on `` extraordinary sex ratios '' . fisher ( <year> ) had proposed a model as to why `` ordinary '' sex ratios were nearly always <other> ( but see edwards <year> ) , and likewise extraordinary sex ratios , particularly in wasps , needed explanations . hamilton had been introduced to the idea and formulated its solution in <year> when he had been assigned to help fisher 's pupil a.w.f . edwards test the fisherian sex ratio hypothesis . hamilton combined his extensive knowledge of natural history with deep insight into the problem , opening up a whole new area of research . the paper was also notable for introducing the concept of the `` unbeatable strategy '' , which john maynard smith and george r. price were to develop into the evolutionarily stable strategy ( ess ) , a concept in game theory not limited to evolutionary biology . price had originally come to hamilton after deriving the price equation , and thus rederiving hamilton 's rule . maynard smith later peer reviewed one of price 's papers , and drew inspiration from it . the paper was not published but maynard smith offered to make price a co-author of his ess paper , which helped to improve relations between the men . price committed suicide in <year> , and hamilton and maynard smith were among the few present at the funeral.hamilton was regarded as a poor lecturer . this shortcoming would not affect the popularity of his work , however , as it was popularised by richard dawkins in dawkins ' <year> book the selfish gene . in <year> he married christine friess and they were to have three daughters , helen , ruth and rowena . <integer> years later they amicably separated . hamilton was a visiting professor at harvard university and later spent nine months with the royal society 's and the royal geographical society 's xavantina-cachimbo expedition as a visiting professor at the university of são paulo . from <year> hamilton was professor of evolutionary biology at the university of michigan . simultaneously , he was elected a foreign honorary member of american academy of arts and sciences . his arrival sparked protests and sit-ins from students who did not like his association with sociobiology . there he worked with the political scientist robert axelrod on the prisoner 's dilemma , and was a member of the bach group with original members arthur burks , robert axelrod , michael cohen , and john holland . == chasing the red queen == hamilton was an early proponent of the red queen theory of the evolution of sex ( separate from the other theory of the same name previously proposed by leigh van valen ) . this was named for a character in lewis carroll 's through the looking-glass , who is continuously running but never actually travels any distance : `` well , in our country , '' said alice , still panting a little , `` you 'd generally get to somewhere else—if you ran very fast for a long time , as we 've been doing . '' `` a slow sort of country ! '' said the queen . `` now , here , you see , it takes all the running you can do , to keep in the same place . if you want to get somewhere else , you must run at least twice as fast as that ! '' ( carroll , pp . <integer> ) this theory hypothesizes that sex evolved because new and unfamiliar combinations of genes could be presented to parasites , preventing the parasite from preying on that organism : species with sex were able to continuously `` run away '' from their parasites . likewise , parasites were able to evolve mechanisms to get around the organism 's new set of genes , thus perpetuating an endless race . == return to britain == in <year> , he was elected a fellow of the royal society , and in <year> , he was invited by richard southwood to be the royal society research professor in the department of zoology at oxford , and a fellow of new college , where he remained until his death . from <year> , hamilton found companionship with maria luisa bozzi , an italian science journalist and author . his collected papers , entitled narrow roads of gene land , began to be published in <year> . the first volume was entitled evolution of social behaviour . == social evolution == the field of social evolution , of which hamilton 's rule has central importance , is broadly defined as being the study of the evolution of social behaviours , i.e . those that impact on the fitness of individuals other than the actor . social behaviours can be categorized according to the fitness consequences they entail for the actor and recipient . a behaviour that increases the direct fitness of the actor is mutually beneficial if the recipient also benefits , and selfish if the recipient suffers a loss . a behaviour that reduces the fitness of the actor is altruistic if the recipient benefits , and spiteful if the recipient suffers a loss . this classification was first proposed by hamilton in 1964.hamilton also proposed the coevolution theory of autumn leaf color as an example of evolutionary signalling theory . == expedition to the congo == during the 1990s , hamilton became increasingly interested in the controversial argument that the origin of hiv lay in oral polio vaccines trials conducted by hilary koprowski in africa during the 1950s . a letter by hamilton on the topic to the major peer-reviewed journal science was rejected in <year> . despite this rejection , he gave supportive declarations on the hypothesis to the bbc and wrote the foreword of a <year> book , the river , by journalist edward hooper , who investigated the hypothesis . to look for indirect evidence of the opv hypothesis by assessing natural levels of simian immunodeficiency virus , in primates , in early <year> , hamilton and two others ventured on a field trip to the then-war-torn democratic republic of the congo . however , none of the over <integer> urine and faecal samples collected by hamilton contained detectable siv virus . == death == he returned to london from africa on <integer> january <year> . he was admitted to university college hospital , london , on <integer> january <year> . he was transferred to middlesex hospital on <integer> february <year> and died there on <integer> march <year> . an inquest was held on <integer> may <year> at westminster coroner 's court to inquire into rumours about the cause of his death . the coroner concluded that his death was due to `` multi-organ failure due to upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage due to a duodenal diverticulum and arterial bleed through a mucosal ulcer '' . following reports attributing his death to complications arising from malaria , the bbc editorial complaints unit 's investigation established that he had contracted malaria during his final african expedition . however , the pathologist had suggested the possibility that the ulceration and consequent haemorrhage had resulted from a pill ( which might have been taken because of malarial symptoms ) lodging in the diverticulum ; but , even if this suggestion were correct , the link between malaria and the observed causes of death would be entirely indirect.a secular memorial service ( he was an agnostic ) was held at the chapel of new college , oxford on <integer> july <year> , organised by richard dawkins . he was buried near wytham woods . he , however , had written an essay on my intended burial and why in which he wrote : i will leave a sum in my last will for my body to be carried to brazil and to these forests . it will be laid out in a manner secure against the possums and the vultures just as we make our chickens secure ; and this great coprophanaeus beetle will bury me . they will enter , will bury , will live on my flesh ; and in the shape of their children and mine , i will escape death . no worm for me nor sordid fly , i will buzz in the dusk like a huge bumble bee . i will be many , buzz even as a swarm of motorbikes , be borne , body by flying body out into the brazilian wilderness beneath the stars , lofted under those beautiful and un-fused elytra which we will all hold over our backs . so finally i too will shine like a violet ground beetle under a stone . the second volume of his collected papers , evolution of sex , was published in <year> , and the third and final volume , last words , in <year> . == awards == <year> foreign honorary member of american academy of arts and sciences <year> fellow of the royal society of london <year> newcomb cleveland prize of the american association for the advancement of science <year> darwin medal of the royal society of london <year> scientific medal of the linnean society <year> frink medal of zoological society of london <other> wander prize of the university of bern <year> crafoord prize of the royal swedish academy of sciences <year> kyoto prize of the inamori foundation <year> fyssen prize of the fyssen foundation <year> honorary title of academician of science in finland <year> member of the american philosophical society == biographies == alan grafen has written a biographical memoir for the royal society . a biographical book has also been published by ullica segerstråle : segerstråle , u . <year> . nature 's oracle : the life and work of w. d. hamilton . oxford university press . == works == === collected papers === hamilton started to publish his collected papers starting in <year> , along the lines of fisher 's collected papers , with short essays giving each paper context . he died after the preparation of the second volume , so the essays for the third volume come from his coauthors . hamilton w.d .

ornithologist . she graduated with an undergrad in <year> and obtained her phd in <year> both from uc berkeley . she taught for several years and pioneered studies of avian life history and physiology on the white-crowned sparrow . despite facing discrimination because she was a woman , she went on to publish over <integer> works and was the <year> recipient of the cooper ornithological society ’ s loye and alden miller research award , which is given in recognition of lifetime achievement in ornithological research . == early life == barbara blanchard dewolfe was born on may <days> , <year> in san francisco , california . she was the only child to her two parents , marion and elizabeth blanchard . though originally from san francisco , dewolfe moved to mill valley , california to live with her grandmother when she was ten years old . she was often sick as a child and was not able to attend school for her first two years in mill valley . she graduated tamalpais high school in <year> and went on to study at uc berkeley where she graduated with a bachelor ’ s degree in zoology in 1933.after graduation , she hoped to pursue teaching as a career . however , during the great depression , jobs were difficult to come by and schools wanted to hire teachers who had experience in multiple disciplines . due to the difficulty of finding a job , dewolfe decided to get a graduate degree and , under the advice of joseph grinnell , pursued her phd.after obtaining her bachelor 's degree , dewolfe went on to get her ph.d. in zoology at uc berkeley in 1939.dewolfe was married twice . her first marriage was to nels oakeson from <year> to <year> and her second was to robert dewolfe in <year> to his death in <year> . == career == dewolfe took her first position in <year> after completing her phd at placer junior college in rocklin , california . she then began teaching at uc davis where she taught zoology . however , due to world war <integer> , education was suspended and she was let go . then , in <year> she moved to massachusetts and began teaching at smith college , a women 's college . she did not like the culture of the east coast and decided to move back west . in <year> , she moved back west and began teaching at the university of california , santa barbara . dewolfe taught until <year> when she became the associate dean of the college of letters and science at uc santa barbara and later in life donated to the uc santa barbara vertebrate museum . == research == dewolfe 's research focused on the white-crowned sparrow . she studied living populations , rather than stuffed animals as was the previous method , in california and alaska . she was observed variations in breeding and song to help determine differences between the races of the sparrow . she focused on three different species of the white-crowned sparrow : the zonotrichia leucophrys pugetensis , the z. l. nuttalli , and the z. i. gambelii . the main difference she observed was the z. i. pugetensis migrated while the z. i. nuttalli did not . it was also observed that the z. i. nuttalli showed breeding behavior for six months , went through gonadal recrudescence in december <days> had a slight prenatal molt , did not carry much fat , and had several local song dialects . the z. l. pugetensis showed breeding behavior for four months , did not have breeding size gonads until after mid-april , put on large amounts of fat prior to migration , and had a small number widespread song dialects . her later work on the z. l. gambelii showed it was a long-distance migrating sparrow , had very different breeding distributions , and had no clear geographically structured song dialects . her research on reproduction , song , and historical differences rather than simple physical differences led to the white-crowned sparrow being one of the most researched birds in the world . her research led to over <integer> publications and collaborations with luis baptista and mary erickson.dewolfe received the loye and alden miller research award in <year> for her groundbreaking research into the white-crowned sparrow 's history.during her research , she faced discrimination because she was a woman . her department chair told her , `` we 'll never recommend you for a position for which we have a man available '' and here phd supervisor told her to focus on less difficult work like worms . she experience many other discriminatory instances when searching for a job out of college , such as being refused for job in the national park service because she was a woman . in spite of this discrimination , she was successful as a woman in science and in the field of ornithology . == late life == dewolfe published two autobiographies that reside in the uc santa barbara library , joyous errand ( <year> ) and further recollections ( <year> ) . over the last decade of her life , she experienced many chronic health conditions and she passed away of an intestinal blockage on may <days> , <year> . == references == walt whitman rostow ( october <days> , <year> – february <days> , <year> ) was an american economist , professor and political theorist who served as national security advisor to president of the united states lyndon b. johnson from <year> to 1969.rostow worked in the office of strategic services during world war ii and later was a foreign policy adviser and speechwriter for presidential candidate and then president john f. kennedy ; he is often credited with writing kennedy 's famous `` new frontier '' speech . prominent for his role in shaping us foreign policy in southeast asia during the 1960s , he was a staunch anti-communist , noted for a belief in the efficacy of capitalism and free enterprise , and strongly supported us involvement in the vietnam war . rostow is known for his book the stages of economic growth : a non-communist manifesto ( <year> ) , which was used in several fields of social science . rostow 's theories were embraced by many officials in both the kennedy and johnson administrations as a possible counter to the increasing popularity of communism in asia , africa and latin america . rostow never regretted or apologized over his actions in vietnam , and this stance effectively ostracized him from work in top american universities after his retirement from government service . his elder brother eugene rostow also held a number of high government foreign policy posts . == early life == rostow was born in manhattan , new york city , to a russian jewish immigrant family . his parents , lillian ( helman ) and victor rostow , were active socialists , and named walt after the poet walt whitman . rostow 's father , victor rostowsky , was born in the town of orekhov near odessa in <year> , and was involved in the russian socialist movement as a teenager , publishing a left-wing newspaper in the basement of his parents ' house calling for the overthrow of the emperor nicholas ii . in <year> , at the age of <integer> , victor rostowsky boarded a ship that took him from odessa to glasgow and another ship that took him to new york . upon arriving in the united states , rostowsky `` americanized '' his surname to rostow . on <integer> october <year> , he married lillian helman , the intellectually gifted daughter of russian jewish immigrants who longed go to college , but as her family was too poor to afford higher education , she instead encouraged her sons to attain the higher education she wanted for herself . like the rostowskys , the helmans were ashkenazim ( yiddish-speaking jews ) . the rostows were described as being very `` idealistic '' immigrants who deeply loved their adopted country and named their three sons after the three men they considered to be the greatest americans , namely eugene v. debs , walt whitman and ralph waldo emerson.unlike many other ashkenazi jewish immigrants , victor rostow always spoke to his children in english rather than yiddish as he felt this was would improve their chances in life . rostow 's brother eugene , who was named for eugene v. debs , became a legal scholar , and his brother ralph , a department store manager . the american journalist stanley karnow described rostow as extremely intelligent with a `` brilliant '' academic record that saw him graduate from high school at the age of <integer> . rostow described his childhood as mostly happy with the only dark spots being that sometimes his classmates called him and his brothers `` dirty jews '' .rostow 's parents closely followed events in russia and rostow later recalled a defining moment of his life occurred as a teenager when his parents invited over for a dinner a group of fellow jewish socialists together with a man who was serving as a purchasing agent for the soviet government . after the dinner , rostow remembered that his father said : `` these communists took over the tsarist police and made them worse . the tsarist police persecuted the political opposition but never touched their families . these people touch families too . nothing good will come of it '' . rostow entered yale university at the age of <integer> on a full scholarship and graduated at <integer> . he then won a rhodes scholarship to study at balliol college , oxford , where he completed a b.litt . degree . at oxford , rostow became friends with future politicians edward heath and roy jenkins , being especially close to the latter . in <year> , during the edward viii abdication crisis , he assisted broadcaster alistair cooke , who reported on the events for the nbc radio network . after returning to yale university , completing his ph.d. in <year> , he started teaching economics at columbia university . == professional and academic career == during world war ii , rostow served in the office of strategic services under william joseph donovan . among other tasks , he participated in selecting targets for us bombardment . nicholas katzenbach later joked : `` i finally understand the difference between walt and me [ ... ] i was the navigator who was shot down and spent two years in a german prison camp , and walt was the guy picking my targets . '' <days> september <year> , rostow arrived in london to serve as an intelligence analyst with the enemy objectives unit , serving until the spring of 1945.in january <year> , rostow was given the task of identifying the key industries that supported the german war economy . as an intelligence analyst , rostow became convinced in <year> that oil was germany 's achilles heel , and if the united states army air force were to target the romanian oil fields together with the plants for making artificial oil and oil shortage facilities within germany itself , then the war would be won , a strategy known as the `` oil plan '' . by early <year> , rostow had finally won over general carl spaatz to the merits of the `` oil plan '' . in early <year> , there was much debate about the merits of the `` oil plan '' vs. the `` transportation plan '' of targeting the german and french railroad system . the `` transportation plan '' was implemented first as part of the run-up to operation overlord . the `` oil plan '' began to be implemented as a strategy by the army air force <days> may <year> , which rostow later called a disastrous error , claiming if the `` oil plan '' had been adopted earlier , the war would have been won far earlier . he also claimed that the united states would have entered into the cold war in a far stronger position as he always maintained that if `` oil plan '' had been adopted earlier it would have allowed the u.s. army to push deeper into central europe and even into eastern europe . based on his world war ii experiences , rostow became a convinced advocate of strategical bombing , arguing that it was the bombing campaign against germany 's cities that had won the war . for his work with the enemy objectives unit during the war , rostow was awarded an obe.in <year> , immediately after the war , rostow became assistant chief of the german-austrian economic division in the united states department of state in washington , d.c. rostow was invited to part in the united states strategic bombing survey ( ussbs ) , an assessment of the effects of the strategical bombing campaign on germany 's economy , but he declined . several of rostow 's future foes in the 1960s such as george ball , john kenneth galbraith and arthur m. schlesinger jr. did take part in the ussbs , and came away convinced that the strategical bombing campaign did not cripple the german economy as its advocates had promised , an experience that led these men to doubt the efficacy of bombing north vietnam . through the `` oil plan '' did indeed work as rostow had promised , those taking part in the ussbs also noted that german industrial production peaked <days> december <year> , which led them to doubt the effects of strategical bombing as a way of breaking a nation 's economy . in <year> , he returned to oxford as the harold vyvyan harmsworth professor of american history . in <year> , he became the assistant to the executive secretary of the economic commission for europe , and was involved in the development of the marshall plan . one of rostow 's colleagues recalled : `` in early <year> , walt rostow had a revelation that the unity of germany could not be achieved without the unity of europe , and that the unity of europe could best be approached crabwise through technical cooperation in economic matters , rather than bluntly in diplomatic negotiations '' . rostow 's writings on the subject of european economic unity attracted the attention of undersecretary of state dean acheson , and ultimately jean monnet , the french diplomat regarded as the `` father '' of the european coal and steel community of <year> that became the european economic community in 1957.rostow spent a year at cambridge university as the pitt professor of american history and institutions . he was professor of economic history at the massachusetts institute of technology ( mit ) from <year> to <year> , and a staff member at the center for international studies ( cis ) at the mit from <year> to <year> . the outbreak of the korean war decisively altered rostow 's thinking about the soviet union . until the korean war , rostow had believed that the soviet system would ultimately `` mellow '' on its own accord and he had also viewed the cold war as a largely diplomatic conflict as opposed to a military struggle . the north korean aggression against south korea convinced him that the cold war required a more militarized foreign policy as he called for greater defense spending in a speech in the fall of <year> so a `` larger full mobilization could be carried out quickly . '' to pay for the higher amount of defense spending , rostow urged the american people to accept the need for a `` very high level of taxation appropriated equally '' .from late <year> <days> august <year> , rostow headed the soviet vulnerabilities project . the project , which was sponsored by the cis and received significant support from the u.s. government , sought to identify soviet vulnerabilities with regard to political/psychological warfare , and it received contributions from top sovietologist and psychological warfare specialists . <days> june <year> , rostow headed a group of stalwart cold warriors who were called the quantico vulnerabilities panel which issued a report that advocated nuclear coercion of the soviet union . although the experts were invited by nelson rockefeller , their proposal ran contrary to the policy of the eisenhower administration.in <year> , rostow advised president dwight eisenhower on economic and foreign policy , and in <year> he became a speechwriter for him . <days> may <year> , rostow was deeply shocked when he heard of the french defeat at the battle of dien bien phu , expressing his disgust that french leaders had failed to create a political alignment which would `` effectively rally the vietnamese against the communists '' . rostow believed the communist viet minh fighting for independence from france were a small , radical terrorist minority entirely unrepresentative of the vietnamese people , the majority of whom he believed supported the french-dominated , but nominally independent state of vietnam created in <year> . at the same time , he lashed out at eisenhower for `` refusing to involve american units in combat '' as a plan had been drafted code-named operation vulture calling for the american intervention in vietnam with tactical nuclear weapons . eisenhower had operation vulture contingent upon british involvement , and when the british predictably refused to become involved , used that as an excuse not to execute operation vulture . <days> august <year> , rostow and fellow cia-connected mit economics professor max f. millikan convinced eisenhower to massively increase us foreign aid for development as part of a policy of spreading what he saw as `` american-style '' economic growth in asia and elsewhere , backed by the military . unlike many of the first generation of `` cold warriors '' who saw the cold war in essentially euro-centric terms , rostow viewed the cold war as a global struggle in which the third world was its most important battlefield . rostow often accused people such as george f. kennan and dean acheson of being racists because they viewed europe as being far more important than asia . on <integer> february <year> , rostow first met senator john f. kennedy , who was impressed with the academic who understood power . on <integer> february <year> , rostow appeared as a witness before the senate foreign relations committee , where as prearranged , kennedy asked him a question about american economic aid to india , which led to the reply the `` present aid program , which amounts to about $ <integer> million this year , is grossly inadequate '' . the purpose of the testimony was to embarrass eisenhower whom both men believed was neglecting the third world . rostow wrote two speeches for kennedy , which he delivered on the senate floor , attacking the eisenhower administration for ignoring india , while the soviet union was not , and led ultimately india being granted $ <integer> million in exchange credits from the import-export bank later that year . <days> september <year> , rostow left to take a professorship at cambridge university , where he started writing his magnum opus , a book intended to debunk marxism as a theory that became the stages of economic growth . at a time when nikita khrushchev was boasting that the soviet union with its five year plans would soon surpass the united states as the world 's dominant economic power because what he interpreted as marxist theory explained both the past and the future , there was much desire in the american political and intellectual establishments to assess its ideological dimensions . == the stages of economic growth == in <year> , rostow published the stages of economic growth : a non-communist manifesto , which proposed the rostovian take-off model of economic growth , one of the major historical models of economic growth , which argues that economic modernization occurs in five basic stages of varying length : traditional society , preconditions for take-off , take-off , drive to maturity , and high mass consumption . this became one of the important concepts in the theory of modernization in social evolutionism . a product of its time and place , the book argued that one of the central problems of the cold war as understood by american decision-makers , namely that there were millions of people living in poverty in the third world whom communism appealed to , could be solved by a policy of modernization to be fostered by american economic aid and growth . rostow began the book with the question about where the world was going , asking `` is it taking us to communism , or the affluent suburbs , nicely rounded out with social overhead capital ; to destruction ; to the moon ; or where ? '' using the industrial revolution in britain as his case study , rostow sought to rebut karl marx 's construction of history , arguing that marx 's reading of british history , which he based much of his theories upon , was defective . the book was essentially a call for greater american involvement in the third world as rostow wrote that much of the third world was struck in the `` traditional stage '' or `` preconditions for take-off '' stage , but with a little help from the us could reach the `` take-off '' stage . the stages concluded : `` we must demonstrate that the underdeveloped nations ... can move successfully through the preconditions into a well established take-off within the orbit of the democratic world , resisting the blandishments and temptations of communism . this is , i believe , the most important item on the western agenda . `` .guy ortolano argues that as an alternative to marxist class-oriented analysis rostow replaced class with nation as the agent of history . british history then became the base for comparisons . however rostow never explicitly offered the british case as the ideal model for nations to copy . many commentators assumed that was his goal and attention turned to issues of american exceptionalism , and the argument that britain created the modern economy.rostow 's thesis was criticized at the time and subsequently as universalizing a model of western development that could not be replicated in places like latin america or sub-saharan africa . another line of criticism was his thesis that societies based upon `` mass production '' and `` mass consumption '' like those of the west were the ideal society that everyone in the world wanted to emulate . at the time , critical reception was extremely favourable with a book review by harry schwarz in the new york times speaking of rostow 's `` impressive achievement '' of writing `` one of the most influential economic books of the twentieth century '' . in a review in the christian science monitor wrote : `` there is a sharp intelligence at work , producing paragraphs and pages which seem to distill events to an almost unbearable simplicity . this is the special quality of the writer and the book '' . adlai stevenson wrote in a letter to rostow : `` is the future rostowism vs. marxism ? if so , i am ready to vote now '' . much of the success of the stages at the time was due to the fact that it addressed seminal issues in a style that was easy to understand but was sufficiently intellectual enough not to be dismissed as facile and shallow . like the various theories of marxism that he had hoped to debunk , rostow offered up a grand theory , in this case , the `` modernization theory '' that explained the past and predicted the future . the swiss scholar gilbert rist wrote of `` rostow 's marvelous fresco of humanity marching towards greater happiness '' and his theories as `` marxism without marx '' as rostow asserted that capitalism was inevitably destined to triumph because , in his view , it was the superior system . the american historian michael shafer wrote about the modernization theory as `` a logical construct , deduced from a set of universal axioms abstracted from the realm of human and temporal contingencies '' .in south korea , at the time a third world nation , much interest in rostow 's book was expressed by both economists and policy-makers . rostow 's concept of `` economic take-off '' especially appealed to the south korean president , general park chung-hee , who often used that phrase in his speeches calling for south koreans to work harder so that their nation could rise up to a first world economy . park , who seized power in a <year> coup d'état , starting in <year> inaugurated a policy of five year plans under which the south korean chaebol had to meet certain targets set by the government as part of the push to reach the `` economic take-off '' stage . a <year> book theory and condition of korean economic development published by the government had <integer> essays by leading economists , of which half described sought to apply the theories set out in the stages of economic growth to south korea . == service under the kennedy and johnson administrations == the stages of economic growth impressed presidential candidate john f. kennedy , who appointed rostow as one of his political advisers , and sought his advice . after attempting unsuccessfully to be appointed to a major post under the eisenhower administration , rostow decided to try his luck with kennedy in <year> . during the <year> election , rostow served as a speech-writer and adviser for the kennedy campaign , where he became known as an `` effervescent idea man '' . rostow wrote the speech calling for a `` new frontier '' , which kennedy gave when he won the democratic nomination . the favorable reception to the `` new frontier '' speech led kennedy to promise rostow a senior position if he won the election . rostow also coined the slogan of kennedy 's <year> campaign `` let 's get the country moving again '' . initially , kennedy wanted to give rostow a major post in his administration . after rostow wrote a policy paper <days> december <year> to outline the incoming kennedy administration 's `` flexible response '' nuclear posture to replace the eisenhower administration 's `` massive retaliation '' nuclear doctrine , in which he stressed that the united states should be willing to use nuclear weapons in southeast asia to counter a `` possible breakout '' by china , the man whom kennedy nominated to serve as his secretary of state dean rusk , vetoed rostow 's appointment.when kennedy became president in <year> , he appointed rostow as deputy to his national security assistant mcgeorge bundy . through rostow was just bundy 's deputy , in practice he served as an equal as initially kennedy was greatly influenced by the advice he received from the renowned , world famous economist . just before kennedy was inaugurated as president on <integer> january <year> , on <integer> january <year> , the soviet leader , nikita khrushchev delivered a speech in moscow declaring that the soviet union was allegedly able and willing to support any `` war of national liberation '' anywhere in the third world . khrushchev 's speech was largely a response to the sino-soviet split of <year> as mao zedong had accused khrushchev of `` revisionism '' and denounced the soviet union for not supporting third world anti-colonial and nationalist movements . as such , mao announced that he regarded himself as the proper leader of the world communist movement , causing khrushchev to strike back with his speech in moscow announcing his willingness to support `` wars of national liberation '' . missing the context of sino-soviet rivalry , kennedy and his advisers regarded khrushchev 's speech as a bold new soviet gambit for world domination , making the subject of the third world a key concern for him . the first meeting of the national security council under kennedy on <integer> january <year> was entirely devoted to the subject of the third world with the president reading out excerpts of khrushchev 's `` wars of national liberation speech '' to underline the danger . rostow , who always saw the third world as the main `` battlefield '' of the cold war , enjoyed much influence with the new president at first . as the apostle of the modernization theory , rostow laid out policies to counter communism in the third world . rostow supported the bay of pigs invasion , albeit with reservations , arguing the existence of a communist government in cuba was unacceptable as otherwise the rest of latin america might be `` infected '' with communism . along the same lines , rostow was the main inspiration for the alliance for progress , a $ <integer> billion aid program for latin america launched with great fanfare by kennedy in <year> who in a speech written by rostow spoke of how the alliance for progress would allow latin america to reach the `` economic take-off '' stage of growth by having an annual growth rate of 2.5 % ( a target chosen by rostow ) , which would end the appeal of communism in latin america forever . rostow was also instrumental in persuading kennedy that the best way to fight communism in the third world in general , not just latin america , was to increase aid , and in <year> american aid to the rest of the third world went up to $ 4.5 billion from $ 2.5 billion in <year> . in a speech written by rostow , kennedy announced that the 1960s would be the `` decade of development '' , saying that the united states was willing and able to furnish sufficient foreign aid to allow the third world nations to reach the `` economic take-off '' stage.rostow annoyed kennedy as an `` idea-a-minute man '' , causing him to complain that rostow had too many ideas for his own good and was unable to focus on what was really important . kennedy 's main complaint was that rostow would in a rapid-fire fashion offer up a deluge of ideas , which made him hard to follow . kennedy had come into the white house <days> january <year> as a confirmed hawk , who during the <year> election had criticized eisenhower as `` soft on communism '' for not overthrowing fidel castro , but the disaster of the bay of pigs invasion <days> april had cooled his martial ardor . after the bay of pigs invasion , he came to distrust the hawkish advice he received from the cia and the joint chiefs of staff . as a result , kennedy also rejected the hawkish advice he received from rostow , charging the experts had all told him that the bay of pigs invasion could not possibly fail . just after the bay of pigs invasion , kennedy rejected advice from rostow to send u.s. troops to laos . the economist john kenneth galbraith advised his friend kennedy that laos was not worth a war , and kennedy himself noted to supply forces in laos would present severe logistical problems . finally remembering how the approach of american forces upon the yalu river led to chinese intervention in the korean war , the president was concerned that intervening in laos would cause a war with china that he did not want . instead , kennedy sent the diplomat w. averell harriman to negotiate an agreement to `` neutralize '' laos , which marked the beginning of the feud between rostow and harriman as the former started to see the latter as an appeaser.kennedy also charged that rostow was too fixated on vietnam , saying he seemed to have an obsession with that country as he spent much time talking about vietnam . rostow believed in the `` domino theory '' , predicating that if south vietnam fell , the rest of southeast asia would also fall like so many dominoes , and ultimately india would fall as well . as early <days> june <year> , rostow was advising kennedy to bomb north vietnam . during the berlin crisis of <year> , rostow advised kennedy : `` we must find ways of putting pressure on khrushchev 's side of the line with conventional forces or other means ... we must begin now to present khrushchev with the risk that if he heightens the berlin crisis , we and the west germans may take action that will cause east germany to come unstruck '' . the particular action that rostow advised kennedy to take was to `` take and hold a piece of territory in east germany that khrushchev may not wish to lose ( for example , magdeburg ) '' . kennedy rejected this advice as too dangerous , stating that having u.s forces seize part of east germany would almost certainly cause a nuclear war with the soviet union . later that year , rostow became director of the state department 's policy planning staff . at the time , kennedy commented : `` walt is a fountain of ideas ; perhaps one in ten of them is absolutely brilliant . unfortunately six or seven are not merely unsound , but dangerously so . i admire his creativity , but it will be more comfortable to have him creating at some remove from the white house '' .kennedy told rostow that his being demoted from the white house to the state department was because : `` over here in the white house we have to play with a very narrow range of choices ... we ca n't do long-range planning ; it has to be done over there . i want you to go over there and catch hold of the process at the level where it counts '' . appealing to kennedy 's catholicism , rostow complained that : `` i am going from being a priest in rome to being a bishop in the provinces . '' <days> october <year> , rostow went on a fact-finding mission with general maxwell taylor to south vietnam and he returned full of enthusiasm for greater american involvement in what he stated `` might be the last great confrontation '' with communism . the report that taylor and rostow wrote advocated that kennedy sent between 6,000 and 8,000 u.s army troops to fight in south vietnam under the guise of being `` flood relief workers '' . kennedy rejected the taylor-rostow report 's recommendation that he sent troops to fight in south vietnam , but accepted the report 's other recommendations calling for more military and economic aid to south vietnam . karnow described rostow as a man who `` seemed to revel in the war '' as it appeared that he wanted to prove that a short , bald , bespectacled new york intellectual could be just as hard , tough and macho as the idealized world war ii veteran that hollywood kept portraying in action films at the time . rostow had served in world war ii as an intelligence analysis with the task of selecting bombing targets in germany , an important , but comfortable `` desk job '' that ensured he never saw combat , a point about which he was very sensitive.in february <year> , president ngo dinh diem introduced the strategic hamlet program of forcibly relocating peasants to strategic hamlets as a way of severing the population from the viet cong guerrillas . though impetus for the strategic hamlet program came from diem , rostow supported the program as a way of breaking down the `` traditional person '' , arguing that the strategic hamlets would be agents of modernization . he remained baffled as to why the strategic hamlets were so unpopular with south vietnamese peasants . in <year> , rostow drafted the statement of basic national security policy ( bnsp ) , a <other> document meant to outline the foreign policy of the kennedy administration . reflecting his interest in the modernization theory , rostow identified the third world , especially `` the arc from iran to korea '' as the most important `` battlefield '' of the cold war . through to some extent based upon the theory of `` containment '' as argued by george f. kennan in the 1940s , rostow 's bnsp argued for the united states to promote economic growth in the third world and for the creation of `` a wider community of free nations , embracing latin america , africa , asia and the middle east '' . kennan who was serving as the us ambassador in belgrade at the time reviewed the bnsp vigorously criticized the document . kennan attacked rostow 's advocacy of a winnable nuclear war , writing he would `` rather see my children dead '' than live in a world devastated by nuclear war . kennan also criticized rostow 's optimism about process in the third world , writing that the third world was hopelessly backward and might be a danger to the us if allowed to process . however , some of the statements in kennan 's critique , where he argued that a first world standard of living was `` peculiar to peoples who have had their origins on or near the shores of the north sea '' or to nations descended from such peoples like the united states allowed rostow to accuse kennan with some justification of racism.during the cuban missile crisis , rostow was mostly excluded from the decision-making process , having only meeting with kennedy during the crisis where he advised him to stop soviet ships carrying oil to cuba , advice that was not taken . unaware that kennedy had promised not to invade cuba and to pull american missiles out of turkey as part of the resolution , rostow saw the cuban missile crisis as a triumph , which proved the superior power of the united states . inspired by the cuban missile crisis , rostow on <integer> november <year> called in a memo for the bombing of north vietnam , writing : `` the whole lesson of the cold war including the recent cuba crisis is that communists do not escalate in response to our actions '' . in <year> , rostow started to advocate what became known in washington as the `` rostow thesis '' , namely if the united states bombed north vietnam along the same lines that germany and japan were bombed in world war ii , then the north vietnamese would have to cease trying to overthrow the government of south vietnam.in <year> , rostow first advocated invading north vietnam , arguing for american and south vietnamese landings on the coast of north vietnam as the prelude for reuniting vietnam under the saigon government . in a policy paper addressed to the assistant secretary of state for asian affairs , w. averell harriman , dated <integer> february <year> , that began with the sentence : `` before you decide your old and respectful friend has gone off his rocker ... '' , rostow advocated invading north vietnam . as the approach of u.s. troops to the yalu river in <year> led to the chinese intervention in the korean war , it was generally accepted within washington that invading north vietnam would likewise lead to a war with china . for this reason , harriman was not impressed with rostow 's paper and advised kennedy to send rostow back to his perch in academia , saying that rostow was far too blasé about the possibility of a nuclear war with china . the chinese nuclear program was well advanced by <year> , and in <year> china exploded its first atomic bomb , followed by its first hydrogen bomb in <year> . rostow underlined this consideration in paper addressed <days> july <year> , stating it would be best to invade north vietnam before the chinese `` blow a nuclear device '' . harriman was one of the richest men in the united states , who was very generous in donating to the democratic party , and as such served as a friend and adviser to every democratic president from roosevelt to johnson . the persistence which rostow advocated invading north vietnam even after the first chinese nuclear test in <year> worried harriman , and he consistently sought to club rostow 's influence , making him into one of rostow 's main enemies in washington.after kennedy 's assassination , his successor lyndon b. johnson promoted rostow to bundy 's job after he wrote johnson 's first state of the union speech . kennedy had generally ignored rostow 's advice , but johnson started to pay attention to him after he wrote a paper <days> february <year> stating a strategic bombing campaign against north vietnam would be enough to win the war . when the american ambassador to laos , william h. sullivan , wrote <days> february <year> he did not believe a strategic bombing would be decisive as the viet cong had a `` sustaining strength of their own '' , rostow was ferocious , arguing the viet cong had no real basis of support in south vietnam and only existed because north vietnam was supporting them . the idea that communism had an appeal to least some of south vietnam 's people was anathema to rostow , who insisted that there was no civil war in south vietnam and there was only a struggle between north vietnam vs. south vietnam . the papers rostow wrote urged a policy of `` graduated '' pressure as the united states would steadily increase the level of bombing to such a point that it would ultimately lead to the destruction of north vietnam 's nascent industry . unlike most american decision-makers , who knew nothing of vietnam 's history , rostow had done much reading on the subject , and had learned that over the centuries that chinese elites considered vietnam a lost province which they would one day reclaim ( vietnam had been a chinese province from <integer> bc to <integer> ad ) , leading to a long series of vietnamese-chinese wars as successive vietnamese emperors fought off attempts by the emperors of china to incorporate vietnam into the middle kingdom . knowing of the full depth of the sino-vietnamese enmity , rostow reached the conclusion that ho chi minh would not want his nation to draw too close to china , and as such , could not risk the destruction of north vietnam 's industry , which would leave north vietnam entirely dependent upon china . one of rostow 's opponents , george ball , argued that ho 's vietnamese nationalism would make him an asian version of josip broz tito of yugoslavia , a communist leader who wanted his nation to be independent of both moscow and beijing . ball argued that south vietnam was a poor and politically unstable ally that contributed little to american national security , and allowing ho to reunify vietnam would pose no danger to the united states . rostow , by contrast , argued that south vietnam was the crucial to american national security and to allow the first `` domino '' to fall would cause the other `` dominoes '' in southeast asia ; in his mind , losing any nation to communism , even it was of the titoist type was unacceptable.starting <days> february <year> , rostow championed the idea of congress giving president johnson the power to wage war in southeast asia , an idea that he first suggested <days> february <year> . rostow pointed out in a memo to the president that the degree of escalation in the vietnam war envisioned by the administration would pose constitutional and legal problems as the constitution gave congress , not the president , the right to declare war and the level of escalation envisioned would be a war in everything , but name . rostow ' solution to this problem was for congress to pass a resolution giving the president the legal power to essentially wage a war in vietnam.when congress passed the gulf of tonkin resolution on <integer> august <year> , which was the closest thing to a declaration of war that the united states had in vietnam , rostow was well pleased . about the gulf of tonkin incident that led to the resolution , rostow later said : `` we do n't know what happened , but it had the desired effect '' . <days> november <year> , rostow advised johnson to commit u.s. ground forces to vietnam to prove that `` we are prepared to face down any form of escalation '' and to send `` massive '' naval and air forces to strike north vietnam and if necessary , china as well . in a memo to johnson , rostow wrote : `` they [ the vietnamese communists ] will not actually accept a setback until they are sure that we mean it '' and needed to know that `` they now confront a lbj who has made up his mind '' .in the <year> election , the republican candidate , senator barry goldwater , ran on a platform promising an aggressive foreign policy that would achieve a `` total victory '' over communism ( by which goldwater presumably meant the soviet union and china ) . by contrast , johnson sought to portray himself as just as `` tough on communism '' as goldwater while also portraying his opponent as a right-wing extremist who was likely to cause a nuclear war . the republican slogan `` in your heart you know he 's right '' was mercilessly lampooned by the democrats with the counter-slogan `` in your guts you know he 's nuts ! '' in the context of the <year> election , johnson found the idea of a gradual process of escalating american involvement in vietnam appealing as it allowed him to present both as a `` tough '' president while also less extreme than goldwater . rostow 's consistent advocacy of a strategic bombing against north vietnam as the decisive way to win the war endeared him to johnson as it promised a `` cheap '' victory that would not cost too many american lives . the national security adviser johnson had inherited from kennedy , mcgeorge bundy , greatly annoyed the president as he spoke with an upper-class new england accent that johnson found patronizing . when bundy developed doubts about the vietnam war in early <year> , johnson sacked him . == national security advisor == as national security advisor , rostow was responsible for developing the government 's policy in vietnam , and was convinced that the war could be won , becoming johnson 's main war hawk and playing an important role in bringing johnson 's presidency to an end . rostow was extremely close to johnson , later recalling : :johnson took me into his house as well as his staff , into his family ; took my family in as well . it was an open-hearted , human relationship . i came to hold the greatest possible affection for him , love for him , as well as respect for the job . i had an enormous compassion for what he was bearing during those years , for what the family was bearing . at the time the appointment of rostow as national security advisor was well received with almost all of the american media praising johnson for appointing such an eminent economist and historian to advise him . in an editorial the new york times wrote that rostow was : a scholar with an original mind as well as an experienced official and policy planner ... one of the architects of john f. kennedy 's foreign policy ... mr. rostow , of course , will be only one of the president 's principal advisers , and mr. johnson will make his own decisions . but the appointment places beside the president an independent and cultivated mind that , as in the bundy era , should assure comprehension both of the intricacies of world problems and of the options among which the white house must choose . no president could ask for more . johnson stated at the time that : `` i 'm getting walt rostow as my intellectual . he 's not your intellectual . he 's not bundy 's intellectual . he 's not schlesinger 's intellectual . he 's not galbraith 's intellectual . he 's going to be my goddamn intellectual ! '' johnson because of his origins as a man from the impoverished , harsh world of texas who spoke his english with a heavy texas twang and who had rather crude manners always felt a certain sense of inferiority when dealing with patrician ivy league intellectuals like mcgeorge bundy , arthur schlesinger and john kenneth galbraith , who all served under kennedy . kennedy and his closest advisers always regarded johnson as `` white trash '' from texas , a vulgar man whose company had to be endured rather than enjoyed . johnson felt that rostow 's status as a jewish intellectual from new york who likewise worked his way up from poverty made him into a kindred soul in a way that `` kennedy 's intellectuals '' never could be for him . one of johnson 's favorite advisers , jack valenti , recommended rostow to the president.johnson 's background growing up poor on a farm in texas left him with a sympathy for the underprivileged , and he was very interested in rostow 's plans for third world development . rostow later recalled about johnson : `` he was always for the underdog '' . through johnson believed that africa was a hopeless disaster , he had great hopes for developing latin america and asia , remembering how the new deal infrastructure projects of the 1930s had transformed texas , until then a very backward state . as rostow 's specialization was the subject of the economic modernization of the third world , his area of expertise appealed to the president , who often talked grandly of his plans to bring electricity to the rural areas of south vietnam as the necessary prelude to ending poverty in south vietnam . finally , rostow 's consistently optimistic appraisal of the vietnam war appealed to johnson while his reputation as a hardliner was meant to signal that johnson was prepared to do whatever it took to win the war . the abrasive johnson , who was notorious within washington for mistreating his staff , `` initiated '' rostow by humiliating him by first leaking news of his appointment to the press , and then calling up to accuse him of being the leak . after unleashing a torrent of obscurities and screaming at him , the president hung up the phone without giving rostow a chance to reply . johnson always `` initiated '' his staff by humiliating them in some way to assert his dominance , and rostow seems not to have taken it personally.rostow consistently argued to johnson that any effort at a peaceful resolution to the vietnam war would be `` capitulation '' . in his reports to johnson , rostow always put the emphasis on information that portrayed the united states as winning , becoming johnson 's favourite adviser on foreign affairs . the optimistic reports that the hawkish rostow wrote were much preferred by the president to the more pessimistic reports written by the `` doves '' in the administration . a typical memo from rostow on <integer> june <year> read : `` mr. president , you can smell it all over . hanoi 's operation , backed by the chicoms [ chinese communists ] , is no longer being regarded as the wave of the future out there . u.s. power is beginning to be felt '' . the ambassador-at-large w. averell harriman called rostow `` america 's rasputin '' as he considered him to have a sinister power over johnson 's mind , as he always pressed the president to take a harder line on vietnam against the advice of his more dovish staff , harriman included . johnson was not enthusiastic about the vietnam war , later telling his biographer doris kearns in a very gendered language that the great society was `` the woman i really loved '' while the vietnam war was `` that bitch of a war on the other side of the world '' . as a president , johnson had often in private complained that he much rather focus on his `` great society '' program intended to end poverty and racism in america and that the vietnam war was an unwanted distraction . given these views , harriman found it mystifying that johnson should shun his advice about finding a way for the united states to gracefully exit vietnam while accepting the counsel of rostow . johnson remembered how the `` loss of china '' in <year> had badly damaged the democratic administration of harry s. truman who was excoriated by the republicans as `` soft on communism '' and criminally negligent in allowing the `` loss of china '' , attacks that resonated with the american people at the time . johnson once told a reporter joseph kraft , in an `` off-the-record '' conversation : i knew that harry truman and dean acheson had lost their effectiveness from the day the communists took over china . i believe that the loss of china had played a large role in the rise of joe mccarthy . and i knew that all these problems , taken together , were chickenshit compared with what might happen if we lost vietnam ... i do n't give a damn about these little pinkos on the campuses , they 're just waving their diapers and bellyaching because they do n't want to fight . the great black beast for us is the right wing . if we do n't give this war over soon they 'll put enormous pressure on us to turn it into an armageddon and wreck all our other programs . johnson was fearful that if he allowed the `` loss of vietnam '' , it would cause a similar right-wing backlash that would allow a `` reactionary '' republican to win the presidency and for the gop to take control of congress , and together they would end his great society program along with the rest of johnson 's civil rights legislation . much of rostow 's influence on johnson was due to his insistence that to protect his domestic achievements that johnson had to fight the vietnam war , and moreover that the war was eminently winnable provided that the correct policies were followed . for johnson , rostow offered him a way out of an unpleasant situation of fighting a war in vietnam that he rather not fight to protect the great society by promising him what rostow insisted was a path to victory , as rostow noted that presidents who win wars were usually also popular presidents.in particular , rostow persistently argued to the president that a programme of sustained bombing would force north vietnam to cease its support of the viet cong and thus win the war . rostow believed that strategic bombing alone would be enough to force north vietnam to capitulate , and became the main advocate in the white house of operation rolling thunder , the bombing offensive launched against north vietnam <days> february <year> . initially , rostow believed in only bombing certain targets as a way of warning hanoi to cease supporting the viet cong , but he changed his mind , coming to favour an all-out bombing offensive that would completely destroy the economy of north vietnam . reflecting the lessons of the oil plan , rostow in particular believed that the destruction of the north vietnamese oil shortage facilities and the hydroelectric grid would so economically cripple north vietnam that the war would be won , and he pressed johnson to end the restrictions on bombing oil shortage tanks and hydro plants . rostow was opposed by harriman , who like him had spent much of world war ii living in england ; however , harriman had first-hand observed how german bombing of british cities had hardened the will of the british public , and he now argued that american bombing on north vietnam was having the same effect on the north vietnamese public . the fact that rostow had arrived in london in fall of <year> , when the worse of the german bombing was over , while harriman as a special envoy for president roosevelt had witnessed first-hand the `` blitz '' against london and other british cities in the winter of 1940–41 contributed to their differing assessments of the effects of bombing . based on his experiences in wartime , harriman called the rostow thesis `` the stick without the carrot '' .the first crisis that confronted johnson and rostow was the buddhist uprising in south vietnam where an attempt by air marshal nguyễn cao kỳ to dismiss general nguyễn chánh thi led to a civil war within the civil war as units of the south vietnamese army fought one another , much to the consternation of johnson who could not believe that america 's allies in south vietnam were fighting each other . rostow for his part advised the president to fully support kỳ , charging that the buddhist struggle movement which had rallied behind thi was being used by the communists . rostow told johnson : `` we are faced with the classic revolutionary situation-like paris in <year> and st. petersburg in <year> '' . rostow claimed that the buddhists were just being used by the viet cong just as lenin used kerensky to take power in <year> , but fortunately american forces were there to save the day . rostow concluded : `` in the face of defeat in the field and kerensky 's weaknesses , lenin took over in november <days> this is about what would happen in saigon if we were not there , but we are there '' . as the civil war within the civil war between kỳ and thi greatly disturbed johnson , rostow 's advice to side with kỳ was decisive . the fact that kỳ expressed much admiration for hitler , who in his own words was his `` only hero '' apparently did not offend rostow . one of rostow 's aides later wrote `` rostow was like rasputin to a tsar under siege '' . rostow 's opponent , george ball wrote about rostow 's influence : `` he played to johnson 's weaker side , always creating an image of johnson standing against the forces of evil . he used to tell him how lincoln was abused by everybody when he was at a certain stage of the civil war ... he spent a great deal of time creating a kind of fantasy for the president '' . <days> august <year> , harriman warned rostow against escalating the war to the brink of a nuclear war with china to best preserve life on plant earth , only to be told `` it is only in extreme crises that such settlements will come '' .at one point in 1966–67 , the hawkish rostow advocated that the united states invade north vietnam , even if it meant war with china , a course of action that mcnamara rejected as likely to cause a nuclear war . rostow always maintained that had his advice to the president to invade north vietnam been taken in <year> or <year> , the war would have been won , telling karnow in an interview in <year> that he was disappointed that johnson rejected his advice to invade north vietnam . johnson remembered how the approach of american forces upon the yalu river in <year> to china intervening in the korean war , and he was very fearful that an american invasion of north vietnam would once again led to a war with china , which now had nuclear weapons . for this reason , johnson was always against invading north vietnam as the risks of a nuclear war with china were too awful for him to consider . through rostow was disappointed that johnson rejected his advice to invade north vietnam , he knew better than to stridently press that idea as that would annoy the president , and instead he brought up the idea of invading north vietnam every so often a couple of months after johnson last rejected it . rostow also chaired a secret `` psychological strategy committee '' whose purpose was to supply `` correct facts '' about the vietnam war to congress , the media and the american people in general.in june <year> , janusz lewandowski , the polish delegate to the international control commission , which was supposed to police the geneva accords of <year> , contacted giovanni d'orlandi , the italian ambassador to south vietnam with a peace offer . lewandowski stated he just spoken with ho chi minh , whom he claimed wanted a `` political compromise '' to end the war and would go `` quite a long way '' for such a settlement . lewandowski reported that ho was willing to drop his demand that the government of south vietnam be overthrown , though he preferred that somebody else other than air marshal nguyen cao ky serve as premier ; asked only the national liberation front ( better known as the viet cong ) `` take part '' in negotiations , instead of serving in the government ; and were willing to accept a `` reasonable calendar '' for the withdrawal of american forces instead demanding their immediate pull-out . the ambassador-at-large harriman and his deputy , the former cia agent chester cooper , were intrigued by the polish offer , which was backed by the soviet union . ever since <year> , mao zedong had been accusing the soviet union of capitulating to capitalism and abandoning its princioples , and a sino-soviet competition had broken out about which of the two states was most willing to support north vietnam . lewandowski stated that the soviets were tired of this economically exhausting competition because every time china increased its support for north vietnam , the soviets had to increase their support on an even greater scale just to rebut the chinese claim that they were `` selling out '' .d'orlandi was able to arrange for lewandowski to meet henry cabot lodge jr , the u.s. ambassador in saigon , and the talks went well . <days> november <year> , it was arranged that john gronouski , the american ambassador in warsaw , would meet with north vietnamese diplomats the next month for peace talks in what was code-named operation marigold . <days> december <year> , american aircraft bombed oil facilities and railroad yards in hanoi , which led the poles to warn if the u.s. continued to bomb hanoi , the talks would be aborted . rostow told the president that he believed that operation marigold was a `` trap '' and the north vietnamese demand that hanoi not be bombed anymore showed the bombing campaign was indeed working as he promised it would . on december <days> , <year> , johnson refused harriman 's request to cease bombing hanoi and a week later , the planned talks in warsaw were cancelled as the north vietnamese announced that there would be no peace talks as long as north vietnam was being bombed . <days> january <year> , rostow reported to johnson that the viet cong were `` disintegrating '' under the american pressure , writing optimistically that the major problem for the americans in the coming year would be to find the best way to integrate those viet cong guerrillas who had surrendered back into civilian life . in a further hopeful sign he reported to the president in the same month that the bloody chaos of the cultural revolution had pushed china to the brink of civil war as `` mao 's own prestige has been seriously , perhaps irretrievably , tarnished in this yet unavailing fracas '' . with china collapsing into chaos , he believed that the chinese would be limited in their ability to support north vietnam for some time to come . in fact , mao continued to support north vietnam during the war with the war serving as a foreign policy counterpart to the cultural revolution as the `` great helmsman '' believed that extreme violence was necessary to maintain communist `` purity '' . the fact that some of mao 's targets in the cultural revolution such as liu shaoqi and deng xiaoping were opposed to increased aid to north vietnam , preferring that the money be spent on chinese development instead , gave him an additional reason to support north vietnam.in november <year> , the israeli defense force raided the village of samu ' in jordan , a move which angered rostow as he told the israeli ambassador abba eban that king hussein of jordan was an american ally and johnson very strongly disapproved of the raid . rostow stated : `` israel for some machiavellian reason , wanted a leftist regime on the left bank [ of jordan ] so that it could then have a polarized situation in which the russians would be backing the arabs and the u.s. backing israel , and that israel would not be in an embarrassing position where one of its friends among the great power would also be a friend of an arab country '' .in february <year> , the soviet premier alexei kosygin visited london , and the british prime minister harold wilson tried to act as a mediator to end the vietnam war , offering to serve as an honest broker . wilson had been asked in <year> to send a british contingent to fight in vietnam , but as his labour party was stoutly opposed to britain fighting in vietnam , he had refused , a move that the normally anglophile secretary of state dean rusk called a `` betrayal '' . to end a running sore in anglo-american relations as wilson was caught between the americans who were pressuring him to send british forces to vietnam and his own party who were pressuring not to , the prime minister was keen to end the vietnam war . kosygin told wilson that soviet influence in north vietnam was limited as the north vietnamese sought to play the soviet union off against china , but if the americans were willing to cease their bombing of north vietnam , the soviet government would indeed pressure ho chi minh to open peace talks . speaking on what he thought was a secure telephone line from the soviet embassy in london to the kremlin , kosygin told the soviet leader leonid brezhnev that there was a `` great opportunity for peace '' , through in the same call he admitted that the militant , ultra-leftwing line taken by china would pose problems . unknown to kosygin , mi5 had tapped the telephone line and a translated transcript of his call to brezhnev was forwarded to wilson . the transcript convinced wilson that kosygin was negotiating in good faith , and the prime minister then contracted the americans . american decision-makers tended to exaggerate soviet influence over north vietnam , and wilson 's message that kosygin was willing to apply pressure on north vietnam was seen by johnson as potentially opening the door for peace . johnson directed david k. e. bruce , the u.s. ambassador to the court of st. james together with harriman 's deputy chester cooper to work alongside wilson in what was code-named operation sunflower . rostow reminded johnson of wilson 's `` betrayal '' in not sending british forces to vietnam and advised the president not to trust him . rostow was extremely negative about operation sunflower , called wilson a vain and dishonest man who was working to end the vietnam war on terms unfavorable to the united states , and did his best to fan johnson 's already strong dislike of wilson . johnson only approved of operation sunflower because it would be too politically embarrassing to turn an opportunity outright.working closely with bruce and cooper , wilson presented a ceasefire offer to kosygin on <integer> february <year> on behalf of the united states , which kosygin promised would be passed on to ho . a few hours later , cooper left his hotel to attend a performance of fiddler on the roof while informing the hotel staff that he would be at the theater if any phone calls came in for him . cooper was at the theater when he an usherette told him that there was an urgent call from washington , saying that a mr. rostow wanted to speak with him at once . in his telephone call , rostow attacked cooper for the conciliatory tone of wilson 's letter , which he called appeasement , and demanding it be rewritten to make it much tougher , a gesture that cooper felt was meant to sabotage operation sunflower . as demanded by rostow , a new letter with considerably more confrontational tone was given to kosygin , which led him to accuse the british and americans of negotiating in bad faith.wilson in a telephone call to johnson complained that the letter as rewritten by rostow had ruined the peace talks and caused `` a hell of a situation '' . wilson charged that kosygin had taken a major risk for peace in vietnam that could have exposed him to criticism within the politburo and certainly would have exposed him to criticism from the chinese who constantly accused the soviets of not doing enough to support north vietnam , and he felt an opportunity for peace had been gratuitously squandered . anxious to salvage something from operation sunflower , wilson , bruce and cooper put forward a new offer to kosygin on <integer> february that the united states would cease the bombing of north vietnam in exchange for no more north vietnamese troops going down the ho chi minh trail . johnson added in the condition that north vietnam had to respond to the offer by noon the next day , a deadline that bruce called `` ridiculous '' and kosygin left london the next day with nothing to show for his peace-making efforts.wilson blamed rostow for the failure of operation sunflower , telling his foreign secretary george brown : `` i suspect that rostow himself was largely responsible for the misunderstandings during the kosygin visit and may well have reported to the president in the light of responsibility '' . karnow wrote it is no means certain that wilson 's claim that a `` historic opportunity '' to end the war in vietnam in <year> had been squandered as all kosygin was promising was to pressure ho to accept a ceasefire and as he himself noted that when the soviets pressured the north vietnamese to do something that they did not want to do , they just drew closer to china . soviet pressure on north vietnam tended to most effective in conjugation with china , and in <year> the chinese were attacking the soviets in the most violent terms , accusing them of abandoning true communism , making any possibility of sino-soviet pressure on north vietnam most unlikely . karnow wrote at most operation sunflower offered was a chance to begin negotiations to end the war , and johnson and rostow shunned that chance.on <integer> april <year> , general william westmoreland asked for another <integer> , <integer> troops for south vietnam , a request that was supported by rostow . rostow went further than westmoreland by asking johnson to invade north vietnam , saying that the american people wanted their president `` do something big and hopefully decisive rather than small '' . at the meeting of the national security council , rostow paced by and fourth before a map of vietnam with a pointer , showing the best way to invade while the defense secretary , robert mcnamara , countered him point by point , stating that the dangers of chinese intervention were far too great . rostow was so disappointed that johnson was more influenced by mcnamara than himself that he almost resigned in protest , before deciding as he put it to `` stay with johnson until the last day , while steadily , but quietly opposed to the way the war was being fought '' .in april <year> , the civil rights leader martin luther king jr. came out against the vietnam war with a speech in new york denouncing the `` immoral war '' whose burden he charged fall disproportionately heavily on black men who more likely to be drafted to fight in vietnam . king 's speech increased the sense of siege in the white house , and hence rostow 's influence . <days> july <year> , allegations of police brutality led to race riots in detroit and newark . in response to the race riots , conservative republicans and democrats accused the johnson administration 's civil rights reforms as being the root reason for the riots . johnson ordered rostow to collect `` such evidence as there is on external involvement in the violent radical community of the negro community in the u.s '' . johnson was apparently hoping that rostow would find evidence that the soviet union and/or china were behind the riots in detroit and newark , but his national security adviser was unable to produce any such evidence . the fact that rostow was ordered to investigate an essentially domestic matter showed that the president thought very highly of him . as the anti-war protests increased , rostow was able to reassure johnson that history will vindicate him , leading the president to remark he was `` a man of conviction who does n't try to play president '' .rostow was finally able to persuade johnson <days> june <year> to bomb north vietnamese oil shortage facilities and hydroelectric plants , predicating this would cause the collapse of north vietnam 's economy and win the war . by contrast , mcnamara reported to the president in the summer of <year> that even though american bombers by destroying hydroelectric plants had reduced north vietnam 's capacity to generate electricity by <integer> % , it had failed to impact meaningfully on the war . mcnamara argued to johnson that rostow did not understand the differences between germany , an advanced , industrialized first world nation vs. north vietnam , a backward , rural third nation nation , and that paradoxically that north vietnam 's very backwardness was a form of strength . mcnamara noted that even before the american bombing , the total annual hydroelectric production of north vietnam amounted only to a fifth of the annual hydroelectric production produced by the potomac electric power company 's plant in alexandria , virginia . for this reason , mcnamara stated that knocking out north vietnam 's hydroelectric plants did not have the same catastrophic effect on the north vietnamese economy that knocking out america 's hydroelectric plants would have had on the american economy . likewise , north vietnam imported all of its oil from the soviet union , and the north vietnamese loaded drums of oil from soviet tankers at sea to sampans , which then entered north vietnam via that country 's intricate network of rivers and canals . for this reason , the destruction of north vietnam 's oil shortage tanks by american bombers in <year> did not affect north vietnam 's capacity to wage war . the north vietnamese developed a system of hiding the oil drums underground all across the country . despite all of the devastation caused by the american bombing between <year> and <year> with ports destroyed and oil shortage tanks left burning , north vietnam doubled its imports of soviet oil , reaching an annual total of 1.4 million tons by <year> . the north vietnamese built some <integer> , <integer> miles of tunnels and underground storage areas during the war to escape the bombing . rostow believed that the bombing tied down north vietnamese men who might otherwise fight in the war by forcing them to engage in reconstruction work , but the north vietnamese government had proclaimed a `` total war '' , mobilized the entire population for the war , and put women to work reconstructing the damage done by american bombers . additionally , some <integer> , <integer> chinese soldiers served in north vietnam between 1965–68 to operate anti-aircraft guns and the sams ( surface to air missiles ) while rebuilding roads and bridges.while working as national security advisor , rostow became involved in setting the united states ' posture towards israel . concerns about israel 's nuclear program were tabled by the united states during the build-up to the six-day war and its aftermath . although he supported military and economic assistance to israel , rostow believed that increased public alignment between the two states could run counter to us diplomatic and oil interests in the region . rostow considered president gamal abdel nasser of egypt to be a moderating force who through he talked belligerently of war , in fact kept the arab-israeli dispute `` in the icebox '' . rostow wrote in a memo advocating american economic aid to egypt : `` while no one likes the idea of paying off a bully , nasser is still the most powerful figure in the middle east ... and has restrained wilder arabs who have for a disastrous arab-israeli showdown '' . after reviewing the may <year> report from the atomic energy commission team that had inspected dimona along with other intelligence , rostow informed president johnson that , though the team found no evidence of a nuclear weapons program , `` there are enough unanswered questions to make us want to avoid getting locked in too closely with israel . when egypt remilitarized the sinai <days> may <year> , rostow did not support an israeli strike against egypt , instead writing `` we sympathize with eshkol 's need to stop these [ palestinian ] raids and reluctantly admit that a limited attack on syria may <days> his only answer '' . about the egyptian remilitarization , rostow wrote that goals of american policy must be `` ( a ) prevent israel from being destroyed ( b ) stop aggression , and ( c ) to keep u thant out in front and stiffen his spine '' . in this regard , rostow wrote it was essential to persuade the israeli prime minister levi eshkol `` not to put a match to this fuse '' . on <integer> may <year> , nasser further escalated the crisis by closing the straits of tiran to israeli shipping , which was a provocation as israel had always stated that they would go to war to keep the straits of tiran open.when the israelis claimed that eisenhower had given israel a security `` guarantee '' in <year> to keep open the straits of tiran , a claim that mystified the americans who had never heard of this `` guarantee '' , rostow was tasked by johnson to investigate . the answer was soon found ; eisenhower had written a letter to the israeli prime minister david ben-gurion in <year> committing the united states to `` guarantee '' that the straits of tiran would be kept open to israeli shipping by the united states . rostow had to inform the israelis that only treaties ratified by congress are binding on the united states , and presidential promises represent only a moral , not a legal commitment on the part of the united states . however , he was later to state : `` from the moment eisenhower made clear that a commitment had been made , johnson had no doubt that he had to reopen the straits '' . rostow backed the regatta plan under which a group of various nations would sail their ships through the strait of tiran as a show of support for israel . rostow believed that the free passage of israeli ships via the straits of tiran was a `` naked principle '' the united states should uphold even it meant a war with egypt . as more and more nations backed out of the regatta plan , rostow came to take a more hawkish stance , saying to johnson that israel should move `` like a sheriff in high noon '' , using violence `` necessary to achieve not merely self-respect , but respect in the region '' . however , johnson did not favor war to resolve the crisis , but as he appeared to be backtracking from the regatta plan , eshkol wrote johnson a letter noting that he had not invaded egypt per american requests , but still the straits of tiran were closed to israeli shipping . johnson in his reply stated he only promised to use all of his constitutional powers to reopen the straits of tiran , noting that because of the vietnam war , he could not risk getting involving in another war at present , telling rostow to make that point clear to the israelis . rostow told the israeli envoy ephraim evron sent to washington that johnson disliked the israeli `` pressure tactics '' and needed more time to study the issues . rostow informed evron : `` you have known president johnson for a long time and have a right to make your own assessment '' . evron predicated that israel would probably go to war if nothing was done to reopen the straits of tiran , telling rostow that were `` about ten days '' of peace left.though rostow , johnson , and secretary of state dean rusk tried to convince israel not to resort to military force , they supported israel once the war began . rostow told the egyptian ambassador , mustafa kamel just before the war : `` your adversaries believe that a surprise attack by egypt and syria is imminent . we know this is unthinkable . we can not believe the government of the uar [ united arab republic ] would be so reckless . such a course would obviously have the most serious possible consequences '' . rostow added that israel had also been given a similar `` friendly warning '' not to escalate . shortly before the war began , johnson asked rostow what he thought israel was going to do , leading rostow to reply `` they 're going to hit '' . at about <other> am on <integer> june <year> , rostow phoned johnson to tell him that israel had just attacked egypt with the israeli air force striking egyptian air force bases all over egypt . on the first day of the six day war , rostow submitted a report to johnson about the destruction of the egyptian air force that began : `` herewith the account , with a map , of the first day 's turkey shoot '' . later that day , rostow in a memo to the president wrote `` we should begin ... talking with the russians and , if possible , with others about the terms of a settlement .... a ceasefire will not answer the fundamental questions in the minds of israelis until they have acquired so much real estate and destroyed so many egyptian planes and tanks that they are absolutely sure of their bargaining position '' .once the war began , rostow saw an opportunity for the united states , writing that the issue `` was whether the settlement of this war shall be on the basis of armistice agreements , which leave the arabs in the posture of hostilities towards israel , keeping alive the israeli issue in arab political life as a unifying force , and affording the soviet union a handle on the arab world ; or whether a settlement emerges in which israel is accepted as a middle eastern state '' . rostow believed that the possibility of israel gaining territory would allow a `` land for peace '' deal which might finally end the arab-israeli dispute , which led him to advocate no ceasefire to end the war until israel captured the golan heights from syria as he maintained the syrians would never make peace until an initiative was provided . rostow favored having a peace plan calling for `` land for peace '' deal to be issued by the united nations , with the negotiations to be mediated by the united states . rostow made it clear that he did not envision israel permanently occupying the gaza strip , the west bank , east jerusalem , the golan heights and the sinai , believing that an occupation would ensure that the arab-israeli conflict would never end . by the third day of the six day war , israeli officials were starting to hint that they were not willing to give up some of their recent territorial gains , especially east jerusalem . <days> october <year> , rostow advised johnson that with israel `` we lean against them just enough to keep their thinking from becoming too quickly set in the concrete of their current extended territorial possessions '' . when the nuclear issue resurfaced <days> january <year> , just prior to prime minister levi eshkol 's visit to the united states , rostow recommended that the president make it clear that the united states expected israel to sign the npt.in september–october <year> , operation pennsylvania peace initiative was launched , when a professor of political science at harvard , henry kissinger , got into contact with a french biologist , herbert marcovich , who in turns was friends with the resistance hero , raymond aubrac who was a friend of ho chi minh . aubrac and marchovich visited hanoi to meet ho to discuss peace . rostow was opposed to operation pennsylvania plan , and turn his best to turn johnson against it . under rostow 's influence , johnson sent a message to kissinger : `` i 'm going to give it one more try and if it does n't work i 'm going to come up to cambridge and cut off your balls ! '' kissinger contacted rostow to urge that the u.s pause the bombing to give operation pennsylvania a chance , only to be rebuffed . kissinger was later to call rostow a `` fool '' .during the siege of khe sanh <days> january <year> , rostow reported to president johnson that the north vietnamese were sending their forces to `` re-enact a new dienbienphu '' , predicating that khe sanh would be the decisive battle in <year> and the united states must commit all of its forces to prevent the fall of khe sahn . in this , rostow was playing into north vietnamese hands as the intention by hanoi was to draw away american forces from the main cities of south vietnam as the prelude for the tet offensive . during the tet offensive in <year> , rostow in a report stated that a vietcong attack against a remote village in south vietnam had been timed to coincide with a debate in congress about appropriations for the war , leading karnow to sarcastically write `` as if tacticians in hanoi consulted the congressional record before deploying their units '' . during the tet offensive , rostow urged johnson to give a `` war leader speech '' in preference to a `` peace leader speech '' . <days> february <year> , rostow clashed repeatedly with the cia director , richard helms , who accused him of distorting intelligence to present a more optimistic picture of the war than was warranted.during the debate in washington in the aftermath of the tet offensive about whatever to send more troops to south vietnam or not , rostow argued that firmness in vietnam was needed to deter `` aggression ... in the middle east , elsewhere in asia and perhaps even in europe '' and recommended that u.s ground forces enter north vietnam and laos to sever the ho chi minh trail . rostow urged johnson that `` it is time for a war leader speech instead of a peace-seeker speech '' . in the aftermath of the tet offensive , rostow argued that now was the time to finish off the vietnamese communists and urged johnson to send <integer> , <integer> more american troops to south vietnam to join the half-million already there and to bomb north vietnam even harder . during the debates , the out-going defense secretary robert mcnamara , who had been repeatedly bested in debates by rostow , snapped in fury : `` what then ? this goddamned bombing campaign , it 's worth nothing , it 's done nothing , they dropped more bombs than on all of europe in all of world war ii and it has n't done a fucking thing ! '' at that point , mcnamara , who had become disillusioned with the war he had once supported , broke down in tears , asking johnson plaintively to stop listening to rostow and saying the war could not be won . rostow had supported johnson 's decision to appoint clark clifford as defense secretary as he was known to be a hawk , and was greatly dismayed when the new defense secretary turned out to be more of a dove than mcnamara was.johnson was badly spooked by his near-defeat in the new hampshire democratic primary , which he won by only <integer> votes against the anti-war senator eugene mccarthy , a politician whom many people did not take seriously . even worryingly for johnson , inspired by this display of presidential weakness in new hampshire , senator robert f. kennedy , a politician whom many people did take seriously , entered the democratic primaries on an anti-war platform on <integer> march <year> . for the wisconsin democratic primary scheduled for <integer> april <year> , the polls <days> march <year> showed kennedy in the lead , mccarthy coming in second and johnson humiliatingly coming in third . faced with a situation where there was a real possibility of him losing the democratic nomination to be his party 's candidate in the <year> election , johnson decided to consider a political as opposed to a military solution to the vietnam war . clifford had despite expectations turned out to be more dovish in office , and pressed the president to find an `` honorable way out '' of vietnam . johnson sought the advice of the so-called `` wise men '' , a group of elder statesmen who advised him to find a way to end the war . the leader of the `` wise men '' , the former secretary of state dean acheson , told rostow `` tell the president—and you tell him in precisely these words—that he can take vietnam and stick it up his ass '' . on <integer> march <days> when johnson met the `` wise men '' , he was informed that `` we must take steps to disengage '' . johnson 's highest level of education had been at the southwest texas teacher 's college , and throughout his life , he had much respect for those with university degrees from the `` eastern establishment '' . of the <integer> `` wise men '' , only general omar bradly , supreme court justice abe fortas , the diplomat robert murphy and general maxwell taylor favored fighting on with the other ten favoring disengagement.during the <year> election , rostow did his best to sabotage the peace talks going on paris as the american delegation led by his old enemy harriman negotiated with the north vietnamese in paris . by this point , rostow was consumed with hatred for harriman , and he missed an opportunity to disparage to johnson . on <integer> april <year> , rostow that harriman should not head the american peace delegation to paris because `` he lacks—and always lacked—an understanding and sympathy with the south vietnamese '' . through johnson was sympathetic , he argued that harriman 's record as a distinguished diplomat going back to world war ii qualified him to head the delegation . rostow attached to the peace delegation a staffer from the national security council , william jorden , with orders `` to keep an eye on those bastards and make sure that they did n't give away the family jewels '' .rostow changed his opinions to suit the president 's changed mood in the summer of <year> and now advised johnson to limit the bombing raids against north vietnam . by the time of the democratic convention in chicago <days> august <year> , rostow approved of the compromise campaign plank of the man who won the democratic nomination , vice president hubert humphrey , which called for an end of the u.s. bombing of north vietnam , as by this point he feared that the republican candidate , richard nixon , would win the election . <days> august <year> , the democratic party was tearing itself apart , divisions that were all too apparent at the democratic convention where anti-war and pro-war democrats vehemently debated on the convention floor about whatever the united states should continue fighting in vietnam or not . given the disarray in the democratic ranks , it was widely felt if the party did not find a way of unifying itself , nixon would win . when humphrey asked for rostow 's help with campaign slogans , rostow came up with the awkward `` we 're not going to let a handful of white and black punks turn this country over to wallace , strom thurmond , and those who base their campaigns on their support '' . by this , rostow meant that a divided democratic party might allow people like george wallace , the outspoken white supremacist former governor of alabama who was running for president as a third-party candidate , or senator storm thurmond , a democrat who turned republican out of his opposition to civil rights for afro-americans , would come to power.based upon information provided by the national security agency , which broken the south vietnamese diplomatic codes , senior officials johnson administration had learned that anna chennault , the chairwoman of the republican women for nixon group had met the south vietnamese ambassador , bui diem , to tell him that south vietnam should sabotage paris peace talks to improve the chances of nixon winning the election . on <integer> october <year> , rostow told johnson he now had information `` on how certain republicans may have inflamed the south vietnamese to behave as they have been behaving '' . rostow also advised johnson not to go public with this information , saying he should instead tell nixon in private to keep away from chennault , advice which was taken . by the fall of <year> , rostow had come to feel that it was better if nixon won the election rather than the `` defeatist '' humphrey who on the campaign trail had become increasingly critical of the war . in one of his memos to johnson , rostow , who was still unhappy about johnson 's decision not to invade north vietnam , wrote he should say if asked about civilian-military relations : `` generally speaking , the military has wanted us to use more power , earlier and faster . they may have been right . but the president had other considerations to think of '' . it was a mark of rostow 's influence that johnson , who was well known for being abrasive towards subordinates , did not explode in rage as he would have if anyone else wrote such a memo . == public intellectual == when richard nixon became president in <year> , rostow left office , and over the next thirty years taught economics at the lyndon b. johnson school of public affairs at the university of texas at austin with his wife elspeth rostow , who later became dean of the school . in <year> , he was told that because of his support for the vietnam war that he was not welcome to resume teaching at mit , forcing him to take up a position at the university of texas . by <year> the general consensus amongst the liberal american intelligentsia was that the vietnam war was a horrific mistake of epic proportions and when rostow left government service <days> january <year> , he found himself an unpopular figure with the liberal intelligentsia , making it impossible for him to return to mit . rostow 's biographer , the british historian david milne , wrote : `` in <year> , rostow 's notoriety was such that none of america 's elite universities were willing to offer him a job '' . for a man who had previously held professorships at harvard , oxford , cambridge , and the mit , it was considered within academic circles to be a real comedown for him to teach at the university of texas.he wrote extensively in defense of neoliberal economics , particularly in developing nations . rostow 's successor as national security adviser , the harvard professor , henry kissinger , was obsessed with the fear of becoming `` this administration 's walt rostow '' whose support for the vietnam war ruined his reputation with the liberal sections of the american intelligentsia and led him teaching at the university of texas , which was regarded as a second-rate university , a fate that kissinger was keen to avoid . kissinger wanted to resume his professorship at harvard as he did not want to end up teaching at an `` unacceptable '' institution like the university of texas as rostow did.rostow himself noted that the university of texas campus was ultra-modern as the texas government had used its oil wealth to create a gleaming , modernistic campus , but complained that the university administration was more interested in supporting the football team , the longhorns , than in research and teaching . from <year> to <year> , rostow served as one of the ghostwriters on johnson 's memoir , the vantage point , writing all of the chapters dealing with foreign affairs . as the teaching load at the university of texas was very light , rostow had much time for research and between <year> and <year> wrote <integer> books , mostly on world economic history with a particular focus on economic modernization . in his own memoir , the diffusion of power , rostow argued that for the justice of the vietnam war and lashed out at kennedy for ignoring his advice in <year> to invade north vietnam , writing that this `` was the greatest single error of u.s foreign policy in the 1960s '' . reflecting his friendship with johnson , rostow was less harsh towards him in his memoir , but still he charged that johnson was too worried about the possibility of a nuclear war with china and should have taken his advice to invade north vietnam , arguing that the risk of a nuclear war with china was acceptable . the main villain in the diffusion of power was mcnamara , who rostow accused of being a defeatist from <year> onward , charging that it was his weakness and doubts about the war that caused johnson to hold back and not invade north vietnam.in the 1980s , rostow visited south korea , whose economy had greatly industrialized under the rule of general park . during his visit , rostow praised south korea as the best example of the theories he set out in the stages of economic growth , arguing that general park 's policies had indeed pushed south korea into an `` industrial take-off '' . in <year> , rostow told the south korean economist park taey-gyun that the experience of south korea proved the correctness of the stages of economic growth and expressed the wish that more third world leaders had been like general park ; though the economist park noted that general park 's policy of five year plans did not reflect rostow 's ideas.in <year> , a book by rostow the united states and the regional organization of asia and the pacific , 1965–1985 was published . in this book , rostow advanced the thesis that the united states had actually `` won '' the vietnam war , as he contended the war had `` brought time '' for the rest of south-east asia to economically advance and escape communism . rostow based his argument along the contention that based on the ways things were going in south vietnam in <year> that the country would have fallen to the communists that year , and the american intervention , which though it failed to save south vietnam in the end , gave an extra ten years to allow the rest of south-east asia to economically advance , ensuring that the other `` dominoes '' did not fall . rostow argued that the economic success of most of the members of the association of south-east asian nations , which comprised indonesia , malaysia , singapore , brunei , thailand and the philippines was due to the vietnam war `` buying time '' for them , as none of those nations ended up being communist and with the exception of the philippines , all of them were `` asian tigers '' ( i.e . rapidly growing economies ) .in <year> , mcnamara published his memoir in retrospect when he famously declared about the vietnam war `` we were wrong , terribly wrong '' . on <integer> june <year> in the times literacy supplement , rostow wrote a scathing review of in retrospect under the title `` the case for the war '' , where he accused mcnamara of insulting all of the families of americans who died in vietnam and argued that the united states had in fact `` won '' the vietnam war as the non-communist states of southeast asia `` had quadrupled their real gnp between <year> and <year> '' , which rostow argued would not have happened had the united states not fought in vietnam . the review in the times literacy supplement reflected the intense feud between mcnamara and rostow ; the latter made much of the fact that mcnamara often suffered from depression and suggested that his `` defeatism '' was due to an unsound mind . rostow believed that mcnamara had suffered a nervous breakdown in <year> and his `` defeatism '' about vietnam was due to the fact he had `` cracked '' under the strain of war . milne wrote that it is indeed correct that mcnamara suffered from bouts of depression , but there is nothing to support rostow 's claim he had lost his mind as defense secretary . milne also wrote that rostow 's assertion that high economic growth rates in southeast asia justified the vietnam war was callous towards the families of all the americans and vietnamese who died in the war . ==

( november <days> , <year> – november <days> , <year> ) , was one of america 's foremost demographers . a native to baltimore , maryland , he earned his bachelor of arts in <year> , his master of arts in <year> , and ( after a period of service in the navy ) his ph.d. in <year> , all at princeton university . a long-term director of the office of population research at princeton , coale was especially influential for his work on the demographic transition and for his leadership of the european fertility project . == early childhood and education == ansley coale was the youngest of three children born from nellie and james coale . one year after he was born , his family moved to cleveland , ohio , where he spent most of his early years receiving an `` excellent '' education.the coale family moved to annapolis , maryland , in <year> . ansley coale attended a public high school starting in <year> . his intentions were to enroll in princeton university like his older brother , jim , did in <year> . by the time ansley was <integer> years old , he was ready to graduate high school . after an extra year at the mercersburg academy , a preparatory school , he was accepted into princeton . this extra year of education was not only important for his intellectual development , but he ended up having <integer> companions from the academy that also went to princeton.after he obtained his bachelor 's of arts ( ba ) and master 's degree in economics , ansley coale was offered a fellowship by the director of the office of population research , frank notestein , as long as demography was a field of study . over the years , the two of them became well-known demographers . in <year> , six years after he received his master 's degree , ansley coale obtained his ph.d. == works == in addition to being the william church osborne professor of public affairs emeritus and professor of economics emeritus at princeton university , coale was a prolific author , publishing more than <integer> books and articles on a wide variety of demographic topics . his growth and structure of human populations ( <year> ) is considered an essential textbook for those interested in formal demography . he also trained and served as a mentor to many students who would become leaders in the field . coale joined the faculty at princeton in <year> , the same year he received his ph.d. at the same site . he spent his entire academic career at the university 's office of population research , serving as director from <year> to <year> . he was president of the population association of america in 1967–68 and president of the international union for the scientific study of population ( iussp ) from <year> to 1981.coale 's first major influential work was population growth and economic development in low-income countries ( <year> ) , which he co-wrote with edgar hoover . the results , which showed that slowing population growth could enhance economic development , had a major impact on public policy and set the research agenda in this field . this study was followed by regional model life tables and stable populations ( <year> ) , which he co-wrote with paul demeny . these model life tables both established new empirical regularities and proved invaluable in the development of later techniques for estimating mortality and fertility in populations with inaccurate or incomplete data . along with william brass , coale pioneered the development and use of these techniques , first explained in methods of estimating basic demographic measures from incomplete data ( <year> , with demeny ) and in the demography of tropical africa ( <year> , with other demographers ) . perhaps coale 's most major scientific contribution was to the understanding of the demographic transition . the demographic transition , as stated by coale , occurs when a country develops a strong economy , and within the society , low fertility and mortality will start to reflect based upon the economic standpoint . coale was the pioneer of the european fertility project , which examined the decline in marital fertility in europe . the european fertility project 's goal was to correlate the fertility rates within married couples with the rate of infant mortality . coale established three pre-conditions to fertility decline . the first is `` within the conscious of choice . '' in other words , it is up to the individual and within their own decision whether or not to have children . the second is that if a society sees not having children as advantageous , then fertility will decline . the third pre-condition is to have contraception methods ready . it is important to emphasize that a society will start to show signs of fertility decline if these three pre-conditions are met.initiated in <year> , the project resulted in the publication of nine major books summarizing the change in childbearing over a century in the <integer> provinces in europe . the project findings eventually led to the conclusion that even though economical factors can play a role in fertility decline , this is not the absolute determinant of fertility decline . the european fertility project led to a better understanding that infant mortality and fertility decline do not necessarily follow each other . with a long-time interest in the population of russia , which first found outlet in coale 's work on the life tables that he constructed for frank lorimer 's classic the population of the soviet union ( <year> ) , coale also later co-authored a volume on russia for the european fertility project series.toward the end of his career , coale became interested in the population changes in china and understanding the fertility transition there as well as factors affecting the sex ratio at birth . in a <year> study he conducted , india and china were compared in both their population size and fertility trends . a survey named the `` <other> fertility survey '' reached out to women living in various provinces of china and asked them to relate a brief history of their marital status and a family planning discussion . the survey contributed to an understanding of the population and fertility changes that would occur in china shortly after . published in a journal article called population trends in china and india , coale introduced the possible causes of differences in fertility trends in such highly populated countries . these reasons are based on policies put in place to reduce birth rates as well as some cultural differences that come into play . finally , coale presents the future of both countries and states that despite the efforts to reduce birth rates , the countries will remain the most populated . == honors == coale was a member of the national academy of sciences , the american academy of arts and sciences and the american philosophical society , and was a recipient of several honorary degrees from universities including princeton , the university of pennsylvania , the university of louvain and the university of liège . he was also a corresponding fellow of the british academy . == selected bibliography == coale , ansley j .

russian : герман степанович титов ; <integer> september <year> – <integer> september <year> ) was a soviet cosmonaut who , on <integer> august <year> , became the second human to orbit the earth , aboard vostok <integer> , preceded by yuri gagarin on vostok <integer> . he was the fourth person in space , counting suborbital voyages of us astronauts alan shepard and gus grissom . a month short of <integer> years old at launch , he was the youngest person to fly in space until <year> when oliver daemen flew on blue origin <other> at the age of <integer> . since daemen flew a suborbital mission , titov remains the youngest man to fly in earth orbit . titov 's flight finally proved that humans could live and work in space . he was the first person to orbit the earth multiple times ( a total of <integer> ) , the first to pilot a spaceship and to spend more than a day in space . he was also the first to sleep in orbit and to suffer from space sickness ( becoming the first person to vomit in space ) .titov was the first photographer from space : he made the first manual photographs from orbit , thus setting a record for modern first photos of earth from space . he also was the first person to film the earth using a professional quality konvas-avtomat movie camera , which he used for ten minutes.in his subsequent life titov continued to work for the soviet space program , and played a major role in the spiral project where he trained to become the first pilot of an orbital spaceplane . however , after the death of yuri gagarin in a military aircraft accident in <year> , the soviet government decided it could not afford to lose its second cosmonaut , and so titov 's career as test pilot ended . titov served in the soviet air force , attaining the rank of colonel-general . in his final years in post-soviet russia he became a communist politician . despite having been chosen second , after gagarin , to fly into space , it was titov who later proposed the soviet government regularly celebrate cosmonautics day on april <days> , the day of gagarin 's flight . == biography == titov was born in the village of verkhneye zhilino in the altai krai and went to school at the stalingrad military aviation school . after graduating as an air force pilot , he was selected for cosmonaut training in <year> . he flew the vostok <integer> mission launched on <integer> august <year> . it lasted for 25.3 hours and he performed <integer> orbits of the earth . his call sign was eagle ( russian : орёл ) . he landed close to the town of krasny kut in saratov oblast , russia . a month short of <integer> years old at launch , he remained the youngest person to fly in space until july <days> <year> , when his record was surpassed by a dutch teenager , oliver daemen . titov was a member of the communist party of the soviet union , as were almost all the soviet cosmonauts . titov was a fine sportsman , and keen on gymnastics : service in the air force made us strong , both physically and morally . all of us cosmonauts took up sports and pt seriously when we served in the air force . i know that yuri gagarin was fond of ice hockey . he liked to play goal keeper . gherman titov was a gymnastics enthusiast , andriyan nikolayev liked skiing , pavel popovich went in for weight lifting . i do n't think i am wrong when i say that sports became a fixture in the life of the cosmonauts . he was the first person to suffer from space sickness ( motion sickness in space ) and was also the first person to sleep in space . he slept for roughly one orbit and was surprised to wake with his arms floating in the air because of the absence of normal gravity . he returned to sleep after he had his arms under a security belt and slept <integer> minutes more than predicted by the flight plan . he stated , `` once you have your arms and legs arranged properly , space sleep is fine .... i slept like a baby '' . though he had been suffering from space sickness during his orbit , titov celebrated upon landing . his celebration is described as `` a fit of euphoria '' after landing , and on his return flight to kubishev for debriefing , he alarmed the medical staff by opening and downing a beer , in complete violation of the rules.after landing , titov was sent to hospital for further testing to ensure that he was not sick . after his mission , he reportedly engaged in behaviours that could be considered unacceptable for someone working within the space programme . he is reported to have been enthralled in his love of women , excessive drinking , and fast cars , which caused some to theorise that his behaviour had potentially been another side effect of the space sickness he experienced from zero gravity . further testing revealed that not to be the case.during a widely-publicised <year> visit to seattle to tour the century <integer> world 's fair , titov was asked by reporters how his space flight affected his philosophy of life . he replied : `` sometimes people are saying that god is out there . i was looking around attentively all day but i did n't find anybody there . i saw neither angels nor god '' . the utterance was used in soviet anti-religion propaganda , but it was misattributed to yuri gagarin.following his space flight , titov assumed various senior positions in the soviet space programme until his retirement in <year> . in <year> , he was elected to the state duma as a member of the communist party of the russian federation . he died of cardiac arrest in his sauna at the age of <integer> in moscow . he was buried in the novodevichy cemetery . == awards and legacy == gherman titov was awarded the title hero of the soviet union , two orders of lenin , and numerous medals and foreign orders . he was bestowed the title of the hero of socialist labor of bulgaria , hero of labour of vietnam and hero of mongolia . the titov crater on the far side of the moon and titov island in ha long bay are named after him . on <integer> august <year> , the 50th anniversary of titov 's flight , the reconstructed and expanded gherman titov museum was opened in his native village of polkovnikovo , altai krai.the titov space centre is named after him . == cultural references == in arthur c. clarke 's <year> book , <year> : odyssey two ( and the <year> film adaptation <year> ) , the opening scene features a conversation between dimitri moisevitch of the soviet space council and dr. heywood floyd . when moisevitch informs floyd that the soviets will be travelling to jupiter on their new spaceship , the cosmonaut alexei leonov , floyd is initially puzzled , claiming that he thought the ship was to be named after gherman titov . in the book , moisevitch just mentioned that it had been changed to

robinson ( december <days> , <year> – july <days> , <year> ) was an american mathematician noted for her contributions to the fields of computability theory and computational complexity theory—most notably in decision problems . her work on hilbert 's tenth problem ( now known as matiyasevich 's theorem or the mrdp theorem ) played a crucial role in its ultimate resolution . robinson was a <year> macarthur fellow . == early years == robinson was born in st. louis , missouri , the daughter of ralph bowers bowman and helen ( hall ) bowman . : <integer> her father owned a machine equipment company while her mother was a school teacher before marriage . : <integer> her mother died when robinson was <integer> years old and her father remarried . : <integer> her older sister was the mathematical popularizer and biographer constance reid and her younger sister is billie comstock . : <integer> when she was <integer> years old , she was diagnosed with scarlet fever which was shortly followed by rheumatic fever . : <integer> this caused her to miss two years of school . when she was well again , she was privately tutored by a retired primary school teacher . in just one year , she was able to complete fifth , sixth , seventh , and eighth year curriculum . : <integer> she attended san diego high school and was given an iq test which she scored a <integer> , a couple points below average . nevertheless , julia stood out in high school as the only female student taking advanced classes in mathematics and physics . : <integer> she graduated high school with a bausch-lomb award for being overall outstanding in science.in <year> , robinson entered san diego state university at the age of 16. : <integer> dissatisfied with the mathematics curriculum at san diego state university , she transferred to university of california , berkeley in <year> for her senior year . before she was able to transfer to uc berkeley , her father committed suicide in <year> due to financial insecurities . : <integer> she took five mathematics courses in her first year at berkeley , one being a number theory course taught by raphael m. robinson . she received her ba degree in <year> , : <integer> and later married raphael in 1941. : <integer> == mathematical contributions == after graduating , robinson continued in graduate studies at berkeley . as a graduate student , robinson was employed as a teaching assistant with the department of mathematics and later as a statistics lab assistant by jerzy neyman in the berkeley statistical laboratory , where her work resulted in her first published paper , titled `` a note on exact sequential analysis '' . : <integer> robinson received her ph.d. degree in <year> under alfred tarski with a dissertation on `` definability and decision problems in arithmetic '' . : <integer> her dissertation showed that the theory of the rational numbers was an undecidable problem , by demonstrating that elementary number theory could be defined in terms of the rationals . ( elementary number theory was already known to be undecidable by gödel 's first incompleteness theorem . ) here is an excerpt from her thesis : '' this consequence of our discussion is interesting because of a result of gödel which shows that the variety of relations between integers ( and operations on integers ) which are arithmetically definable in terms of addition and multiplication of integers is very great . for instance from theorem 3.2 and gödel 's result , we can conclude that the relation which holds between three rationals a , b , and n if and only if n is a positive integer and a=bn is definable in the arithmetic of rationals . '' === hilbert 's tenth problem === hilbert 's tenth problem asks for an algorithm to determine whether a diophantine equation has any solutions in integers . robinson began exploring methods for this problem in <year> while at the rand corporation . her work regarding diophantine representation for exponentiation and her method of using pell 's equation led to the j.r. hypothesis ( named after robinson ) in <year> . proving this hypothesis would be central in the final solution . her research publications would lead to collaborations with martin davis , hilary putnam , and yuri matiyasevich.in <year> , robinson first met martin davis , then an instructor at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign , who was trying to show that all sets with listability property were diophantine in contrast to robinson 's attempt to show that a few special sets — including prime numbers and the powers of <integer> — were diophantine . robinson and davis started collaborating in <year> and were later joined by hilary putnam , they then showed that the solutions to a “ goldilocks ” equation was key to hilbert 's tenth problem.in <year> , the problem was resolved in the negative ; that is , they showed that no such algorithm can exist . through the 1970s , robinson continued working with matiyasevich on one of their solution 's corollaries , which she once stated that there is a constant n such that , given a diophantine equation with any number of parameters and in any number of unknowns , one can effectively transform this equation into another with the same parameters but in only n unknowns such that both equations are solvable or unsolvable for the same values of the parameters . at the time the solution was first published , the authors established n = <integer> . robinson and matiyasevich 's joint work would produce further reduction to <integer> unknowns . === game theory === during the late 1940s , robinson spent a year or so at the rand corporation in santa monica researching game theory . her <year> technical report , `` on the hamiltonian game ( a traveling salesman problem ) , '' is the first publication to use the phrase `` travelling salesman problem '' . shortly thereafter she published a paper called `` an iterative method of solving a game '' in 1951. : <integer> in her paper , she proved that the fictitious play dynamics converges to the mixed strategy nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum games . this was posed by george w. brown as a prize problem at rand corporation . : <integer> == professorship at uc berkeley == robinson was not allowed to teach in the mathematics department at berkeley after marrying raphael m. robinson in <year> , as there was a rule which prevented family members from working together in the same department . robinson then instead stayed in the statistics department despite wanting to teach calculus . although raphael retired in <year> , it was n't until <year> she was offered a full-time professorship position at berkeley after the department heard of her nomination to the national academy of sciences . == honors == after robinson solved hilbert 's tenth problem , saunders mac lane nominated her for the national academy of sciences . alfred tarski and jerzy neyman also flew out to washington , d.c. to further explain to the nas why her work is so important and how it tremendously contributed to mathematics . in <year> , she was the first female mathematician to be elected to the national academy of sciences . robinson was elected the first female president of the american mathematical society . it took time for her to accept the nomination , stated in her autobiography : '' in <year> i was nominated for the presidency of the american mathematical society . i realized that i had been chosen because i was a woman and because i had the seal of approval , as it were , of the national academy . after discussion with raphael , who thought i should decline and save my energy for mathematics , and other members of my family , who differed with him , i decided that as a woman and a mathematician i had no alternative but to accept . i have always tried to do everything i could to encourage talented women to become research mathematicians . i found my service as president of the society taxing but very , very satisfying . '' in <year> , robinson was given the noether award through the association for women in mathematics and did a lecture series called functional equations in arithmetic . around this time she also was given the macarthur fellowship prize of $ 60,000 . in <year> , she also became a member of the american academy of arts and sciences . == political work == in the 1950s robinson was active in local democratic party activities . she was alan cranston 's campaign manager in contra costa county when he ran for his first political office , state controller . `` i don ’ t remember exactly what happened , but the end result was that julia involved herself during those years in the nitty-gritty of democratic party politics—she registered voters , stuffed envelopes , rang door- bells in neighborhoods where people expected to be paid for their vote . she even served as alan cranston ’ s campaign manager for contra costa county when he successfully ran for state controller—his first political office . '' robinson was also a volunteer for adlai stevenson ’ s presidential campaigns . == death and legacy == in <year> , robinson was diagnosed with leukemia , and she died in oakland , california , on july <days> , <year> . `` one of julia ’ s last requests was that there be no funeral service and that those wishing to make a gift in her memory contribute to the alfred tarski fund , which she had been instrumental in setting up in honor of her late teacher , friend , and colleague . modest to the end , she let her character and achievements speak for themselves . '' the julia robinson mathematics festival sponsored by the american institute of mathematics 2013–present and by the mathematical sciences research institute , 2007–2013 , was named in her honor . george csicsery produced and directed a one-hour documentary about robinson titled julia robinson and hilbert 's tenth problem , that premiered at the joint mathematics meeting in san diego on january <days> , <year> . notices of the american mathematical society printed a film review and an interview with the director . the college mathematics journal also published a film review . == notes == davis , martin ( 1970–1980 ) . `` robinson , julia bowman '' . dictionary of scientific biography . <integer> . new york : charles scribner 's sons . pp . 265–268 . isbn <days> . feferman , solomon , ed .

'' her first job was for a trade magazine , as a secretary , then an editor . she sold articles to the sunday herald tribune , cue magazine , and vogue.she studied at columbia university 's school of general studies for two years , taking courses in geology , zoology , law , political science , and economics . about the freedom to pursue study across her wide-ranging interests , she said : for the first time i liked school and for the first time i made good marks . this was almost my undoing because after i had garnered , statistically , a certain number of credits i became the property of barnard college at columbia , and once i was the property of barnard i had to take , it seemed , what barnard wanted me to take , not what i wanted to learn . fortunately my high-school marks had been so bad that barnard decided i could not belong to it and i was therefore allowed to continue getting an education . == career == after attending columbia university 's school of general studies for two years , butzner found a job at iron age magazine . her <year> article on economic decline in scranton was well publicized and led the murray corporation of america to locate a warplane factory there . encouraged by this success , butzner petitioned the war production board to support more operations in scranton . experiencing job discrimination at iron age , she also advocated for equal pay for women and for the right of workers to unionize . === america === she became a feature writer for the office of war information and then a reporter for amerika , a publication of the u.s. state department . while working there she met robert hyde jacobs jr. , a columbia-educated architect who was designing warplanes for grumman . they married in <year> . together they had a daughter , burgin , and two sons , james and ned . they bought a three-story building at <integer> hudson street . jane continued to write for america after the war , while robert left grumman and resumed work as an architect.the jacobses rejected the rapidly growing suburbs as `` parasitic '' , choosing to remain in greenwich village . they renovated their house , in the middle of a mixed residential and commercial area , and created a garden in the backyard.working for the state department during the mccarthy era , jacobs received a questionnaire about her political beliefs and loyalties . jacobs was anti-communist and had left the federal workers union because of its apparent communist sympathies . nevertheless , she was pro-union and purportedly , appreciated the writing of saul alinsky ; therefore she was under suspicion . on <integer> march <year> , jacobs delivered her response to conrad e. snow , chairman of the loyalty security board at the united states department of state . in her foreword to her answer , she said : the other threat to the security of our tradition , i believe , lies at home . it is the current fear of radical ideas and of people who propound them . i do not agree with the extremists of either the left or the right , but i think they should be allowed to speak and to publish , both because they themselves have , and ought to have , rights , and once their rights are gone , the rights of the rest of us are hardly safe ... === architectural forum === jacobs left amerika in <year> when it announced its relocation to washington , d.c. she then found a well-paying job at architectural forum , published by henry luce of time inc. she was hired as an associate editor . after early success in that position , jacobs began to take assignments on urban planning and `` urban blight '' . in <year> , she was assigned to cover a development in philadelphia designed by edmund bacon . although her editors expected a positive story , jacobs criticized bacon 's project , reacting against its lack of concern for the poor african americans who were directly affected . when bacon showed jacobs examples of undeveloped and developed blocks , she determined that `` development '' seemed to end community life on the street . when jacobs returned to the offices of architectural forum , she began to question the 1950s consensus on urban planning.in <year> , jacobs met william kirk , an episcopal minister who worked in east harlem . kirk came to the architectural forum offices to describe the impact that `` revitalization '' had on east harlem , and he introduced jacobs to the neighborhood.in <year> , while standing in for douglas haskell of architectural forum , jacobs delivered a lecture at harvard university . she addressed leading architects , urban planners , and intellectuals ( including lewis mumford ) , speaking on the topic of east harlem . she urged this audience to `` respect – in the deepest sense – strips of chaos that have a weird wisdom of their own not yet encompassed in our concept of urban order . '' contrary to her expectations , the talk was received with enthusiasm , but it also marked her as a threat to established urban planners , real estate owners , and developers . architectural forum printed the speech that year , along with photographs of east harlem . === rockefeller foundation and death and life of great american cities === after reading her harvard speech , william h. whyte invited jacobs to write an article for fortune magazine . the resulting piece , `` downtown is for people '' , appeared in a <year> issue of fortune , and marked her first public criticism of robert moses . her criticism of the lincoln center was not popular with supporters of urban renewal at architectural forum and fortune . c.d . jackson , the publisher of fortune , was outraged and over the telephone , demanded of whyte : `` who is this crazy dame ? '' the fortune article brought jacobs to the attention of chadbourne gilpatric , then associate director of the humanities division at the rockefeller foundation . the foundation had moved aggressively into urban topics , with a recent award to the massachusetts institute of technology for studies of urban aesthetics that would culminate in the publication of kevin a. lynch 's image of the city . <days> may <year> , gilpatric invited jacobs to begin serving as a reviewer for grant proposals . later that year , the rockefeller foundation awarded a grant to jacobs to produce a critical study of city planning and urban life in the u.s. ( from the <other> to the <other> , the foundation 's humanities division sponsored an `` urban design studies '' research program , of which jacobs was the best known grantee . ) gilpatric encouraged jacobs to `` explor [ e ] the field of urban design to look for ideas and actions which may improve thinking on how the design of cities might better serve urban life , including cultural and humane value . '' affiliating with the new school ( then called the new school for social research ) , she spent three years conducting research and writing drafts . in <year> , random house published the result : the death and life of great american cities . the death and life of great american cities remains one of the most influential books in the history of american city planning . she coined the terms `` social capital '' , `` mixed primary uses '' , and `` eyes on the street '' , which were adopted professionally in urban design , sociology , and many other fields . jacobs painted a devastating picture of the profession of city planning , labeling it a pseudoscience . this angered the male-dominated urban planning profession . using ad hominem attacks , jacobs was criticized as a `` militant dame '' and a `` housewife '' : an amateur who had no right to interfere with an established discipline . one planner dismissed jacobs ' book as `` bitter coffee-house rambling '' . robert moses , sent a copy , called it `` intemperate and also libelous ... sell this junk to someone else . '' later , her book was criticized from the left for leaving out race and openly endorsing gentrification , which jacobs referred to as `` unslumming '' .in <year> , she resigned her position at architectural forum to become a full-time author and concentrate on raising her children . in other political activities she became an opponent of the vietnam war , marched on the pentagon <days> october <year> and criticized the construction of the world trade center as a disaster for manhattan 's waterfront . === struggle for greenwich village === during the 1950s and 1960s , her home neighborhood of greenwich village was being transformed by city and state efforts to build housing ( see , for example , jacobs ' <year> fight to build the west village houses in lieu of large apartment houses ) , private developers , the expansion of new york university , and by the urban renewal plans of robert moses . moses ' plan , funded as `` slum clearance '' by title i of the housing act of <year> , also called for several blocks to be razed and replaced with upscale high-rises . the plan forced <integer> families out of their homes and displaced 1,000 small businesses—the result was washington square village . as part of his efforts to revitalize the area , moses had proposed the extension of fifth avenue through washington square park in <year> . in the face of community opposition , moses had shelved the project , but revived the idea in the 1950s . moses argued that the fifth avenue extension would improve the flow of traffic through the neighborhood and provide access to the planned lower manhattan expressway ( lomex ) , which would connect the manhattan bridge and williamsburg bridge with the holland tunnel.in response , local activist shirley hayes created the `` committee to save washington square park '' , a coalition of dozens of local neighborhood groups that opposed the roadway extension . raymond s. rubinow eventually took over the organization , changing its name to the `` joint emergency committee to close washington square to traffic '' . jacobs had joined the committee under hayes , but she took a more prominent role under rubinow , reaching out to media outlets such as the village voice , which provided more sympathetic coverage than the new york times . the committee gained the support of margaret mead , eleanor roosevelt , lewis mumford , charles abrams , and william h. whyte , as well as carmine de sapio , a greenwich village resident and influential democratic leader . de sapio 's involvement proved decisive . on <integer> june <year> , the city closed washington square park to traffic , and the joint committee held a ribbon tying ( not cutting ) ceremony.plans for lomex expressway continued despite growing community opposition in areas such as little italy . in the 1960s , jacobs chaired the joint committee to stop the lower manhattan expressway . the new york times was sympathetic to moses , while the village voice covered community rallies and advocated against the expressway . jacobs continued to fight the expressway when plans resurfaced in <year> , <year> , and <year> , and she became a local hero for her opposition to the project . she was arrested by a plainclothes police officer on april <days> , <year> , at a public hearing during which the crowd had charged the stage and destroyed the stenographer 's notes . she was accused of inciting a riot , criminal mischief , and obstructing public administration . after months of trials conducted in new york city ( to which jacobs commuted from toronto ) , her charge was reduced to disorderly conduct.new york : a documentary film devoted an hour of the eight-part , seventeen-and-a-half-hour series to the battle between moses and jacobs . robert caro 's biography of moses , the power broker , gives only passing mention to this event , however , despite jacobs 's strong influence on caro . in <year> , caro told an interviewer about the difficulty in cutting more than 300,000 words from his initial manuscript : `` the section that i wrote on jane jacobs disappeared . to this day , when someone says : 'there 's hardly a mention of jane jacobs , ' i think , 'but i wrote a lot about her . ' every time i 'm asked about that , i have this sick feeling . '' == life in toronto == soon after her arrest in <year> , jacobs moved to toronto , eventually settling at <integer> albany avenue in the annex from <year> until her death in <year> . she decided to leave the u.s. in part because she opposed the vietnam war , she worried about the fate of her two draft-age sons , and she did not want to continue fighting the new york city government . she and her husband chose toronto because it was pleasant and offered employment opportunities , and they moved to an area of toronto that included so many americans avoiding the draft that it was called the `` american ghetto '' .she quickly became a leading figure in her new city and helped stop the proposed spadina expressway . a frequent theme of her work was to ask whether cities were being built for people or for cars . she was arrested twice during demonstrations . she also had considerable influence on the regeneration of the st. lawrence neighborhood , a housing project regarded as a major success . she became a canadian citizen in <year> and later , she told writer james howard kunstler that dual citizenship was not possible at the time , implying that her u.s. citizenship was lost.in <year> , she offered a more urban perspective on quebec 's sovereignty in her book , the question of separatism : quebec and the struggle over separation . jacobs was an advocate of a province of toronto to separate the city proper from ontario . jacobs said , `` cities , to thrive in the twenty-first century , must separate themselves politically from their surrounding areas . `` she was selected to be an officer of the order of canada in <year> for her seminal writings and thought-provoking commentaries on urban development . the community and urban sociology section of the american sociological association awarded her its outstanding lifetime contribution award in <year> . in <year> , the city government of toronto sponsored a conference entitled , `` jane jacobs : ideas that matter '' , which led to a book by the same name . at the end of the conference , the jane jacobs prize was created . it includes an annual stipend of $ 5,000 for three years to be given to `` celebrate toronto 's original , unsung heroes – by seeking out citizens who are engaged in activities that contribute to the city 's vitality '' . jacobs never shied away from expressing her political support for specific candidates . she opposed the <year> amalgamation of the cities of metro toronto , fearing that individual neighborhoods would have less power with the new structure . she backed an ecologist , tooker gomberg , who lost toronto 's <year> mayoralty race , and she was an adviser to david miller 's successful mayoral campaign in <year> , at a time when he was seen as a longshot . during the mayoral campaign , jacobs helped lobby against the construction of a bridge to join the city waterfront to toronto city centre airport ( tcca ) . following the election , the toronto city council 's earlier decision to approve the bridge was reversed and bridge construction project was stopped . tcca did upgrade the ferry service and the airport was still in operation as of <year> . in lieu of the bridge , a pedestrian tunnel broke ground <days> march <year> . the tunnel opened on <integer> july <year> . jacobs also was active in a campaign against a plan of royal st. george 's college ( an established school very close to the jacobs residence in toronto 's annex district ) to reconfigure its facilities . jacobs suggested not only that the redesign be stopped but that the school be forced from the neighborhood entirely . although toronto council initially rejected the school 's plans , the decision later was reversed – and the project was given the go-ahead by the ontario municipal board ( omb ) when opponents failed to produce credible witnesses and tried to withdraw from the case during the hearing.she also had an influence on vancouver 's urban planning . jacobs has been called `` the mother of vancouverism '' , referring to that city 's use of her `` density done well '' philosophy.jacobs died in toronto western hospital aged <integer> , on <integer> april <year> , apparently , of a stroke . she was survived by a brother , james butzner ( d. <year> ) ; a daughter , burgin jacobs , her sons , james and ned of vancouver , and by two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren . upon her death her family 's statement noted : `` what 's important is not that she died but that she lived , and that her life 's work has greatly influenced the way we think . please remember her by reading her books and implementing her ideas '' . == legacy == jacobs is credited , along with lewis mumford , with inspiring the new urbanist movement . she has been characterized as a major influence on decentralist and radical centrist thought . she discussed her legacy in an interview with reason magazine . reason : what do you think you 'll be remembered for most ? you were the one who stood up to the federal bulldozers and the urban renewal people and said they were destroying the lifeblood of these cities . is that what it will be ? jacobs : no . if i were to be remembered as a really important thinker of the century , the most important thing i 've contributed is my discussion of what makes economic expansion happen . this is something that has puzzled people always . i think i 've figured out what it is . expansion and development are two different things . development is differentiation of what already existed . practically every new thing that happens is a differentiation of a previous thing , from a new shoe sole to changes in legal codes . expansion is an actual growth in size or volume of activity . that is a different thing . i 've gone at it two different ways . way back when i wrote the economy of cities , i wrote about import replacing and how that expands , not just the economy of the place where it occurs , but economic life altogether . as a city replaces imports , it shifts its imports . it does n't import less . and yet it has everything it had before . reason : it 's not a zero-sum game . it 's a bigger , growing pie . jacobs : that 's the actual mechanism of it . the theory of it is what i explain in the nature of economies . i equate it to what happens with biomass , the sum total of all flora and fauna in an area . the energy , the material that 's involved in this , does n't just escape the community as an export . it continues being used in a community , just as in a rainforest the waste from certain organisms and various plants and animals gets used by other ones in the place . while jacobs saw her greatest legacy to be her contributions to economic theory , it is in the realm of urban planning that she has had her most extensive effect . her observations about the ways in which cities function revolutionized the urban planning profession and discredited many accepted planning models that had dominated mid-century planning . the influential harvard economist edward glaeser , known for his work on urban studies , acknowledged that jane jacobs ( 1960s ) had been prescient in attacking moses for `` replacing well-functioning neighborhoods with le corbusier-inspired towers '' . glaeser agreed that these housing projects proved to be moses ' greatest failures , `` moses spent millions and evicted tens of thousands to create buildings that became centers of crime , poverty , and despair . `` she also was famous for introducing concepts such as the `` ballet of the sidewalk '' and `` eyes on the street '' , a reference to what would later be known as natural surveillance . the concept had a huge influence on planners and architects such as oscar newman , who prepared the idea through a series of studies that would culminate in his defensible space theory . the work of jacobs and newman would go on to affect american housing policy through the hope vi program , an effort by the united states department of housing and urban development to demolish the high-rise public housing projects so reviled by jacobs and to replace them with low-rise , mixed-income housing . throughout her life , jacobs fought to alter the way in which city development was approached . by arguing that cities were living beings and ecosystems , she advocated ideas such as `` mixed use '' development and bottom-up planning . furthermore , her harsh criticisms of `` slum clearing '' and `` high-rise housing '' projects were instrumental in discrediting these once universally supported planning practices.jacobs is remembered as being an advocate for the mindful development of cities , and for leaving `` a legacy of empowerment for citizens to trust their common sense and become advocates for their place '' .despite the fact that jacobs mainly focused on new york city , her arguments have been identified as universal . for instance , her opposition against the demolition of urban neighborhoods for projects of urban renewal had `` special resonance '' in melbourne , australia . in melbourne in the 1960s , resident associations fought against large-scale high-rise housing projects of the housing commission of victoria , which they argued had little regard for the impact on local communities.jacobs fought an uphill battle against dominant trends of planning . despite the united states remaining very much a suburban nation , the work of jacobs has contributed to city living being rehabilitated and revitalized . because of her ideas , today , many distressed urban neighborhoods are more likely to be gentrified than cleared for redevelopment . it may <days> that we have become so feckless as a people that we no longer care how things do work , but only what kind of quick , easy outer impression they give . if so , there is little hope for our cities or probably for much else in our society . but i do not think this is so . in her book 'death and life of great american cities , ' written in <year> , ms. jacobs 's enormous achievement was to transcend her own withering critique of <other> urban planning and propose radically new principles for rebuilding cities . at a time when both common and inspired wisdom called for bulldozing slums and opening up city space , ms. jacobs 's prescription was ever more diversity , density and dynamism – in effect , to crowd people and activities together in a jumping , joyous urban jumble . samuel r. delany 's book times square red , times square blue relies heavily on the death and life of great american cities in its analysis of the nature of social relations within the realm of urban studies . === jane jacobs days === after the death of jacobs <days> april <year> , new york city mayor michael bloomberg announced a jane jacobs day , held on june <days> , <year> . the city of toronto proclaimed her birthday the following year , may <days> , <year> , as jane jacobs day . === jane 's walks === in connection with jane jacobs day in toronto , two dozen free neighborhood walks in the city were offered that weekend ( <integer> may <year> ) as an active memorial to jacobs , and they were dubbed jane 's walks . later , a jane 's walk event was held in new york <days> september 29–30 , <year> . in <year> , the event spread to eight cities and towns throughout canada , and by <year> , jane 's walks were taking place in <integer> cities in <integer> countries , on six continents . the interpretive walks typically apply ideas jacobs identified or espoused to local areas , which are explored on foot and sometimes by bicycle . the walks normally take place in early may <days> on or close to her may <days> birth anniversary . walks are organized and led by local volunteers , coordinated by a headquarters office in toronto . there are more than <integer> walks offered in toronto , alone , in <year> , taking place on may <days> , <integer> , and <integer> . === exhibitions === in <year> , to mark the hundredth birth anniversary of jane jacobs , a toronto gallery staged `` jane at home '' , an exhibition running from april <other> <integer> . curated by jane 's son , jim jacobs , it offered glimpses of her home life , where she also worked . her toronto living room was represented , based on the one at her albany avenue house in the annex , where she often spoke with noted thinkers and political leaders including marshall mcluhan , paul martin , and the queen of the netherlands . on display were her typewriter , original manuscripts , rediscovered photographs demonstrating her distinctive styles , and personal mementos . the exhibit included furniture from previous homes in new york ( her dining room is set up ) and from scranton , pennsylvania.in <year> , the municipal art society of new york partnered with the rockefeller foundation to host an exhibit focusing on `` jane jacobs and the future of new york , '' which opened at the society <days> september that year . the exhibit aimed to educate the public on her writings and activism and used tools to encourage new generations to become active in issues involving their own neighborhoods . an accompanying exhibit publication included essays and articles by such architecture critics , artists , activists , and journalists as malcolm gladwell , reverend billy , robert neuwirth , tom wolfe , thomas de monchaux , and william mcdonough . many of these contributors participated in a series of panel discussions on `` jane jacobs and the future of new york '' . === jane jacobs medal === as a tribute to jacobs , the rockefeller foundation , which had awarded grants to jacobs in the 1950s and 1960s , announced on february <days> , <year> , the creation of the jane jacobs medal , `` to recognize individuals who have made a significant contribution to thinking about urban design , specifically in new york city '' . recipients include : barry benepe , co-founder of the new york city green market program and a founding member of transportation alternatives , was awarded with the inaugural jane jacobs medal for lifetime leadership and a $ 100,000 cash prize <days> september <year> . the inaugural jane jacobs medal for new ideas and activism was awarded to omar freilla , the founder of green worker cooperatives in the south bronx ; mr. freilla donated his $ 100,000 to his organization . peggy shepard , executive director of west harlem environmental action , received the <year> jane jacobs medal for lifetime leadership and alexie torres-fleming , founder of youth ministries for peace and justice , received the award for new ideas and activism . both women received their medals and $ 100,000 awards at a dinner ceremony <days> september <year> in new york city . damaris reyes , executive director of good old lower east side ( goles ) , received the <year> jane jacobs medal for new ideas and activism . richard kahan , as founder and ceo of the urban assembly , which created and manages <integer> secondary public schools located in many of the lowest income neighborhoods in new york city , received the <year> jane jacobs medal for lifetime leadership . both received $ 100,000 , in addition to the medal . the <year> recipients were joshua david and robert hammond , whose work in establishing the high line park atop an unused elevated railroad line , led the foundation to award the <year> jane jacobs medal for new ideas and activism , along with $ 60,000 to each man . the <year> jane jacobs medal for lifetime leadership was given to elizabeth barlow rogers , for her longtime work as writer , park administrator , and co-founder of central park conservancy . she received $ 80,000 as well.the canadian urban institute offers an award to honor her , the jane jacobs lifetime achievement award , to recognize a person `` who has had significant impact on the health of their region consistent with jane jacob 's belief that successful cities foster a place-based , community-centered approach . '' the <year> winner was eberhard zeidler , while his daughter , margie zeidler , won the <year> award . in <year> , anne golden took the prize `` for her long-standing leadership in public policy , her academic work and her varied leadership experience in business , not-for-profit and government sectors . '' william ( bill ) teron accepted the <year> award `` for his influential career in public policy and passionate advocacy for quality design and commitment to development in the ottawa area . '' in <year> , jack diamond was recognized for his `` contribution to improving the built form and advocacy for cities and the future of the greater toronto area . `` <days> april <year> , spacing was appointed the stewards of the jane jacobs prize . spacing , winners of the prize in <year> , has continued to provide the award with a new life and new ways of promoting ( and finding ) the winners .

of the <year> documentary film citizen jane : battle for the city , which depicts her victories over robert moses and her philosophy of urban design . == in popular culture == a fictionalized version of her is played by alison smith in a season <integer> episode of the amazon series the marvelous mrs. maisel . the community organizer played by cherry jones in motherless brooklyn has drawn comparisons to jane jacobs . the director , edward norton , has clarified that the composite character was partially based on jacobs , but more so on hortense gabel who was active a decade earlier . the url of the facebook group new urbanist memes for transit-oriented teens ( numtot ) is whatwouldjanejacobsdo . == criticism == the planners and developers she fought against to preserve the west village were among those who initially criticized her ideas . robert moses has generally been identified as her arch-rival during this period . since then , jacobs ' ideas have been analysed many times , often in regard to the outcomes that their influences have produced.in places such as the west village , the factors that she argued would maintain economic and cultural diversity have led instead to gentrification and some of the most expensive real estate in the world . her family 's conversion of an old candy shop into a home is an example of the gentrifying trend that would continue under the influence of jacobs 's ideas.gentrification also was caused , however , by `` the completely unexpected influx of affluent residents back into the inner city '' . the extent to which her ideas facilitated this phenomenon was at the time unimaginable . for example , she advocated the preservation of older buildings specifically because their lack of economic value made them affordable for poor people . in this respect , she saw them as `` guarantors of social diversity '' . that many of these older structures have increased in economic value solely due to their age was implausible in <year> . issues of gentrification have dominated criticism of jane jacobs ' planning ideas.economist tyler cowen has criticized her ideas for not addressing problems of scale or infrastructure , and suggests that economists disagree with some of her approaches to development . for example , although her ideas of planning were praised at times as `` universal '' , they are now thought inapplicable when a city grows from one million to ten million ( as has happened many times in developing nations ) . such arguments suggest that her ideas apply only to cities with similar issues to those of new york , where jacobs developed many of them . == works == jane jacobs spent her life studying cities . her books include : === the death and life of great american cities === the death and life of great american cities is her single-most influential book and , possibly , the most influential book on urban planning and cities . published in <year> , this book was widely read by both planning professionals and the general public . the book is a strong critique of the urban renewal policies of the 1950s , which , she claimed , destroyed communities and created isolated , unnatural urban spaces . in the book , she celebrates the diversity and complexity of old-mixed use neighborhoods while lamenting the monotony and sterility of modern planning . jacobs advocated the abolition of zoning laws and restoration of free markets in land , which would result in dense , mixed-use neighborhoods and she frequently cited new york city 's greenwich village as an example of a vibrant urban community . robert caro has cited it as the strongest influence on the power broker , his pulitzer-winning biography of robert moses , although caro does not mention jacobs by name in the book despite jacobs ' battles with moses over his proposed lower manhattan expressway . caro reportedly cut a chapter about jacobs due to his book 's length.beyond the practical lessons in city design and planning that death and life offers , the theoretical underpinnings of the work challenge the modern development mindset . jane jacobs defends her positions with common sense and anecdotes . === the economy of cities === the thesis of this book is that cities are the primary drivers of economic development . her main argument is that explosive economic growth derives from urban import replacement . import replacement is the process of producing goods locally that formerly were imported , e.g. , tokyo bicycle factories replacing tokyo bicycle importers in the 1800s . jacobs claims that import replacement builds up local infrastructure , skills , and production . jacobs also claims that the increased production is subsequently exported to other cities , giving those other cities a new opportunity to engage in import replacement , thus producing a positive cycle of growth . in an interview with bill steigerwald in reason magazine , jacobs said that if she is remembered for being a great intellectual she will be remembered not for her work concerning city planning , but for the discovery of import replacement . critics erroneously claim that her ideas parrot the idea of import substitution advanced earlier by scholars such as andre gunder frank . import substitution was a national economic theory implying that if a nation substituted its imports with national production , the nation would become wealthier , whereas jacob 's idea is entirely about cities and could be called urban import substitution . however , even this would lead to confusion since in practice , import substitution in india and latin america were government subsidized and mandated , whereas jacobs ' concept of import replacement is a free market process of discovery and division of labor within a city.in the second part of the book , jacobs argues that cities preceded agriculture . she argues that in cities trade in wild animals and grains allowed for the initial division of labor necessary for the discovery of husbandry and agriculture ; these discoveries then moved out of the city due to land competition . another interpretation of history , generally and erroneously considered to be contradictory to jacobs ' is supported by marxist archaeologist vere gordon childe and in recent times , by another historical materialist charles keith maisels these writers argue that agriculture preceded cities . the apparent opposition between childe and jacobs theories rests in their definition of 'city ' , 'civilization ' , or 'urban ' . childe , like other materialists such as maisels or henri lefebvre defines 'urban ' or 'civilization ' as synoecism—as a literate , socially stratified , monolithic political community , whereas , as one can see from the economy of cities or from cities and the wealth of nations , jacobs defines the city purely along the lines of geographically dense trade giving way to entrepreneurial discovery and subsequent improvements in the division of labor . without the requirements of literacy , monumental building , or the signs of specialized civil and armed forces , 'cities ' can be accurately be interpreted to exists thousands of years before when childe and maisels place them . however , the jacobs definition is supposition , since 'city ' is defined simply as a large town or `` a large human settlement '' indicating permanence . the earliest remains of mankind uncovered by archaeologists do not give us more information other than that they were hunter-gatherers as there is no evidence yet of farming or settlement , implying nomadic lifestyles until further discoveries are found . === the question of separatism : quebec and the struggle over sovereignty === the question of separatism incorporated and expanded jacobs ' presentation of the <year> massey lectures , entitled canadian cities and sovereignty-association . it was published in <year> and reprinted in <year> with a previously-unpublished <year> interview with robin philpot on the subject in which she evokes the relative overlooking of that book among her usual readership . this was the first time jacobs was requested to discuss it in an interview . columnist richard gwyn advanced that while not openly criticizing her , english-speaking canadians readers thought she did not understood how canadian politics worked and that she was not being helpful in a time of distress for national unity ( the <year> referendum was just defeated by a vote of <integer> % ) . the question of separatism was also not mentioned in the bibliography of her <year> obituary in the globe and mail.jacobs ' book advances the view that quebec 's eventual independence is best for montreal , toronto , the rest of canada , and the world ; and that such independence can be achieved peacefully . as precedent , she cites norway 's secession from sweden and how it enriched both nations . the origins of the contemporary secessionist-movement in the quiet revolution are examined , along with canada 's historical reliance on natural resources and foreign-owned manufacturing for its own economic development . jacobs asserts that such an approach is colonial and hence backward , citing by example , canada buying its skis and furniture from norway or norwegian-owned factories in canada , the latter procedure being a product of canadian tariffs designed specifically to foster such factories . the relevant public views of rené lévesque , claude ryan , and then prime minister pierre trudeau are also critically analyzed , an example being their failure to recognize that two respective , independent currencies are essential to the success of an independent quebec and a smaller resultant canada , an issue that is central to her book . jacobs stresses the need for montreal to continue developing its leadership of québécois culture , but that ultimately , such a need can never be fulfilled by montreal 's increasing tendencies toward regional-city status , tendencies foretelling economic , political , and cultural subservience to english-speaking toronto . such an outcome , jacobs believed , would in the long run doom quebec 's independence as much as it would hinder canada 's own future . she concludes with her observation that the popular equating of political secession with political and economic failure is the result of the enlightenment , which perceived nature as a force for `` standardization , uniformity , universality , and immutability . '' since then , naturalists and their readers have gradually realized that nature is a force for diversity , and that , `` diversity itself is of the essence of excellence . '' the right kind of secession , jacobs states , can lead to the right kind of diversity , and quebec and canada are capable of both , and must achieve both , to survive . === cities and the wealth of nations === cities and the wealth of nations attempts to do for economics what the death and life of great american cities did for modern urban planning , although it has not received the same critical attention . beginning with a concise treatment of classical economics , this book challenges one of the fundamental assumptions of the greatest economists . classical ( and neo-classical ) economists consider the nation-state to be the main player in macroeconomics . jacobs argues that it is not the nation-state , rather it is the city that is the true player in this worldwide game . she restates the idea of import replacement from her earlier book the economy of cities , while speculating on the further ramifications of considering the city first and the nation second , or not at all . === systems of survival === systems of survival : a dialogue on the moral foundations of commerce and politics moves outside of the city , studying the moral underpinnings of work . as with her other work , she used an observational approach . this book is written as a platonic dialogue . it appears that she ( as described by characters in her book ) took newspaper clippings of moral judgments related to work , collected and sorted them to find that they fit two patterns of moral behavior that were mutually exclusive . she calls these two patterns `` moral syndrome a '' , or commercial moral syndrome , and `` moral syndrome b '' , or guardian moral syndrome . she claims that the commercial moral syndrome is applicable to business owners , scientists , farmers , and traders . similarly , she claims that the guardian moral syndrome is applicable to government , charities , hunter-gatherers , and religious institutions . she also claims that these moral syndromes are fixed , and do not fluctuate over time . it is important to stress that jane jacobs is providing a theory about the morality of work , and not all moral ideas . moral ideas that are not included in her system are applicable to both syndromes . jane jacobs goes on to describe what happens when these two moral syndromes are mixed , showing the work underpinnings of the mafia and communism , and what happens when new york subway police are paid bonuses here – reinterpreted slightly as a part of the larger analysis . === the nature of economies === the nature of economies , a dialog between friends concerning the premise : `` human beings exist wholly within nature as part of the natural order in every respect '' ( p. ix ) , argues that the same principles underlie both ecosystems and economies : `` development and co-development through differentiation and their combinations ; expansion through diverse , multiple uses of energy ; and self-maintenance through self-refueling '' ( p. <integer> ) . jacobs also comments on the nature of economic and biological diversity and its role in the development and growth of the two kinds of systems . jacobs ' characters discuss the four methods by which `` dynamically stable systems <days> may evade collapse : `` bifurcations ; positive-feedback loops ; negative-feedback controls ; and emergency adaptations '' ( p. <integer> ) . their conversations also cover the `` double nature of fitness for survival '' ( traits to avoid destroying one 's own habitat as well as success in competition to feed and breed , p. <integer> ) , and unpredictability including the butterfly effect characterized in terms of multiplicity of variables as well as disproportional response to cause , and self-organization where `` a system can be making itself up as it goes along '' ( p. <integer> ) . the book is infused with many real-world economic and biological examples , which help keep the book `` down to earth '' and comprehensible , if dense . concepts are furnished with both economic and biological examples , showing their coherence in both worlds . one particularly interesting insight is the creation of `` something from nothing '' – an economy from nowhere . in the biological world , free energy is given through sunlight , but in the economic world human creativity and natural resources supply this free energy , or at least starter energy . another interesting insight is the creation of economic diversity through the combination of different technologies , for example the typewriter and television as inputs and outputs of a computer system : this can lead to the creation of `` new species of work '' . === dark age ahead === published in <year> by random house , dark age ahead posits jacobs ' argument that `` north american '' civilization shows signs of a spiral decline comparable to the collapse of the roman empire . her discussion focuses on `` five pillars of our culture that we depend on to stand firm '' , which can be summarized as the nuclear family and community ; quality in education ; free thought in science ; representational government and responsible taxes ; and corporate and professional accountability . as the title of this book suggests , jacobs ' outlook is far more pessimistic than that of her previous works . however , in the conclusion she admits : `` at a given time it is hard to tell whether forces of cultural life or death are in the ascendancy . is suburban sprawl , with its murders of communities and wastes of land , time , and energy , a sign of decay ? or is rising interest in means of overcoming sprawl a sign of vigor and adaptability in north american culture ? arguably , either could turn out to be true . '' while jacobs idealized u.s. democracy , dark age ahead echoes the skepticism and disappointment that led to her emigration to canada in <year> . later , she would indicate that north american cultures , among others , were grounded in a `` plantation mentality '' that was culturally and ecologically unsustainable . == orthodox urbanism == jane jacobs asserts in her work , the death and life of great american cities , that the sources of orthodox urbanism are : garden cities of tomorrow , ebenezer howard the culture of cities , lewis mumford cities in evolution , sir patrick geddes modern housing , catherine bauer toward new towns for america , clarence stein nothing gained by overcrowding , sir raymond unwin the city of tomorrow and its planning , le corbusier == writings == constitutional chaff ; rejected suggestions of the constitutional convention of <year> , with explanatory argument compiled by jane butzner , ( <year> ) columbia university press ; compiled by jane jacobs ( née butzner ) , reprinted <year> by kennikat press , port washington , new york . isbn <days> the death and life of great american cities ( <year> ) new york : random house . isbn <days> the economy of cities ( <year> ) isbn <days> the question of separatism : quebec and the struggle over sovereignty ( <year> random house and <year> baraka books ) isbn <days> cities and the wealth of nations ( <year> ) isbn <days> the girl on the hat ( children 's book illustrated by karen reczuch ) , <days> june <year> ) oxford university press . isbn <days> systems of survival : a dialogue on the moral foundations of commerce and politics ( <year> ) isbn <days> a schoolteacher in old alaska – the story of hannah breece ( <year> ) random house of canada . isbn <days> the nature of economies ( <year> ) new york : random house , the modern library . isbn <days> dark age ahead ( <year> ) isbn <days> vital little plans : the short works of jane jacobs ( <year> ) new york : random house . isbn <days> == see also == david crombie fred gardiner innovation economics urban secession == references == === bibliography === alexiou , alice sparberg ( <year> ) . jane jacobs : urban visionary . new brunswick : rutgers . isbn <days> . allen , max , ed .

( at the same time , american physicists discovered dancoff 's error and solved qed , relying less directly on dancoff . ) during the second world war , dancoff worked on the theory of the newly invented nuclear reactors . to take into account how fuel rods could `` shadow '' other rods by absorbing neutrons headed toward the other rods , he and m. ginsburg developed the dancoff factor , still used in reactor calculations.after the war , dancoff was on the faculty of the university of illinois at urbana-champaign . in <year> he published an approximation method for many-body theory that has been used in nuclear and solid-state physics . igor tamm had found it in <year> , and the method is now named after both . in the late 1940s , dancoff began a collaboration with the viennese-refugee physician and radiologist henry quastler in the new field of cybernetics and information theory . their work led to the publication of what is now commonly called dancoff 's law . a non-mathematical statement of this law is , `` the greatest growth occurs when the greatest number of mistakes are made consistent with survival '' .dancoff died of lymphoma in <year> . == references

was a british evolutionary biologist who made contributions to ornithology , ecology , and ethology . his <year> book , darwin 's finches , on the finches of the galapagos islands was a landmark work as were his other popular science books on life of the robin and swifts in a tower . he developed what is now known as lack 's principle which explained the evolution of avian clutch sizes in terms of individual selection as opposed to the competing contemporary idea that they had evolved for the benefit of species ( also known as group selection ) . his pioneering life-history studies of the living bird helped in changing the nature of ornithology from what was then a collection-oriented field . he was a longtime director of the edward grey institute of field ornithology at the university of oxford . == education and early life == lack was born in london , the oldest of four children of harry lambert lack md frcs , who later became president of the british medical association . the name 'lack ' is derived from 'lock ' . his father grew up in a farming family from norfolk and became a leading ear , nose and throat surgeon at the london hospital . although his father had some interest in birds as a boy it does not appear that he influenced david 's interest . his mother kathleen was the daughter of lt. col. mcneil rind of the indian army . kathleen 's father was scottish and on her mother 's side was part irish , greek and georgian . kathleen had been an actor and was a supporter of women 's suffrage . at home they organized meetings of the poetry society . david was schooled at home until seven and then went to the open air school in regent 's park before going to the hall , hampstead followed by foster 's school , stubbington and gresham 's school , holt , norfolk . lack was taught biology at gresham 's by w.h . foy and g.h . lockett . he went to magdalene college , cambridge and received a ba second class in <year> after studying botany , zoology and geology for part i of the tripos and zoology for part ii.until the age of fifteen , lack lived in a large house in devonshire place , london . the family spent their summers in new romney kent where lack became familiar with the local birds especially on romney marsh . by the age of nine , he had learnt the names of most birds and had written out an alphabetically arranged life-list . in <year> , lack won the holland-martin natural history prize for an essay on `` three birds of kelling heath '' . in <year> , with an essay on 'my favourite birds ' he was the national winner of the senior prize ( a silver medal ) in the public school essay competition , organised by the royal society for the protection of birds . david did not wish to follow his father 's profession in medicine and took an interest in zoology . his father then considered entomology which was then the only professional field in zoology and found work for david at the frankfurt museum in the summer of <year> . he spent four months pinning insects in the senckenberg museum and found it “ extremely ” boring . he joined the cambridge ornithological club whose members included peter scott , arthur duncan , dominic serventy , and tom harrisson . his first scientific paper was on the display of nightjars , published in the ibis in <year> . he joined on several expeditions with cambridge researchers including two to the arctic . lack wrote the birds of cambridgeshire ( <year> ) which was published by the cambridge bird club . in this work , he departed from the contemporary style with a distinct de-emphasis on rare and accidental birds.lack received an sc.d . from cambridge university in <year> . == career and research == after cambridge , lack , on the recommendation of julian huxley took up a position as a science mentor at dartington hall school , devonshire from <year> until summer <year> when he took a year off to study bird behaviour on the galapagos islands . in <year> he made his first trip to the united states as a chaperone for a dartington hall student returning to california . here he met joseph grinnell and robert mccabe and gave a talk at the cooper ornithological club . in new york , he met ernst mayr at the american museum of natural history . he returned via the ss bremen , only one of about four english speakers on the german ship . he was only in the galapagos for part of that year , starting august <year> . with the data that he collected in the galapagos , especially on the finches he went to the united states . april <days> august <year> was spent at the california academy of sciences which held a large collection of the finches of galapagos that had been studied earlier by harry swarth and at ernst mayr 's home in new jersey . while in the us he made a study of the tricoloured blackbird with john t. emlen . he returned home <days> september <year> , after the outbreak of war . lack published the galapagos finches ( geospizinae ) , a study in variation in which he examined variations within species across islands and considered that many of them were non-adaptive and due to founder effect and genetic drift . lack 's first major work was the life of the robin , which was based on four years of field work that he conducted while teaching at dartington hall school . he examined robin behaviour , song , territory , pairing and breeding using ringing to mark and track individual birds . the manuscript was completed in <year> and it went through five editions from <year> to <year> . one of lack 's students at dartington hall was eva ibbotson . a colleague who helped in filming some of the robins for lack was the geography teacher bill hunter . in <year> lack went to tanganyika on an invitation from r.e . moreau . lack was committed to pacificism and debated the philosophy even during his dartington days with the founder of the college , leonard knight elmhirst . during world war ii lack however served with a british army unit called the army operational research group on the orkney islands working on radar use . during this work he met other biologists who had been inducted into the war including george varley , an entomologist who introduced him to the idea of density-dependent regulation of animal populations . lack 's observations on spurious echoes produced by birds would later allow him to establish the field of radar ornithology to study bird migration . lack was released from wartime duty <days> august <year> so as to take a position to as director ( succeeding w.b . alexander ) of the edward grey institute of field ornithology at oxford university , a position that he held until his death in <year> . lack 's work in ornithology was almost entirely based on studies of the living bird . he was one of the pioneers of life-history studies in britain , especially those based on quantitative approaches , when some traditional ornithologists of the time were focussing their studies on morphology and geographic distribution . lack 's major scientific research included work on population biology and density dependent regulation . his work suggested that natural selection favoured clutch sizes that ensured the greatest number of surviving young . this interpretation was however debated by v.c . wynne-edwards who suggested that clutch size was density-independent . this was one of the earliest debates on group selection . lack 's studies were based on nidicolous birds and some recent studies have suggested that his findings may not hold for other groups such as seabirds.as a mentor for numerous doctoral students , lack followed a hands-off method , letting students decide their own research topics . he encouraged students to sort out their ideas and find the `` simplest explanation , which was probably best . '' he would make students work on their papers and give only one reading to their thesis asking them to choose either a draft or a final version to submit.he wrote numerous papers in ornithological journals , and had a knack of choosing memorable titles : he once claimed to have single-handedly caused the renaming of a group of birds through the submission of a scientific paper with the title `` territory and polygamy in a bishop '' . this <year> publication was subsequently titled `` territory and polygamy in a bishop bird , euplectes hordeacea hordeacea ( linn . ) '' in the journal ibis as the journal editor felt that the title might cause misunderstanding . === darwin 's finches === lack 's most famous work is darwin 's finches , a landmark study whose title linked darwin 's name with the galapagos group of species and popularised the term `` darwin 's finches '' in <year> , though the term had been introduced by percy lowe in <year> . there are two versions of this work , differing significantly in their conclusions . the first is a book-length monograph , written after his visit to the galapagos , but not published until <year> . in it lack interprets the differences in bill size as species recognition signals , that is , as isolating mechanisms . the second is the later book in which the differences in bill size are interpreted as adaptations to specific food niches , an interpretation that has since been abundantly confirmed . this change of mind , according to lack 's preface , came about as a result of his reflections on his own data whilst he was doing war work . the effect of this change in interpretation is to put the emphasis for speciation onto natural selection for appropriate food handling instead of seeing it primarily as a by-product of an isolating mechanism . in this way his work contributed to the modern evolutionary synthesis , in which natural selection came to be seen as the prime mover in evolution , and not random or mutational events . lack 's work laid the foundations for the much more extensive work of peter and rosemary grant and their colleagues . lack 's work feeds into studies of island biogeography which continue the same range of issues presented by the galapagos fauna on a more varied canvas . according to ernst mayr , `` the person who more than anyone else deserves credit for reviving an interest in the ecological significance of species was david lack ... it is now quite clear that the process of speciation is not completed by the acquisition of isolating mechanisms but requires also the acquisition of adaptations that permit co-existence with potential competitors . '' === lack 's principle === in <year> lack took an interest in clutch size after reading moreau 's manuscript sent to the ibis . lack was then an assistant to the editor of the ibis . lack postulated what is now known as lack 's principle , which states that `` the clutch size of each species of bird has been adapted by natural selection to correspond with the largest number of young for which the parents can , on average , provide enough food '' . === population regulation === lack took a keen interest in the mechanisms involved in regulating populations in nature . the natural regulation of animal numbers is one of lack 's most frequently cited works . here he gave primacy to natural selection in determining the rate of reproduction and he especially countered the idea that it was adjusted with mortality rates so that constant populations are maintained . it was critiqued by j.b.s . haldane who found it lacking mathematical precision and biased to bird studies . the other major critic was v.c . wynne-edwards with whom he clashed for nearly a decade . lack followed up on the criticisms in his later books including population studies of birds ( <year> ) . === published books === === published journal articles === == awards and honours == <year> : elected fellow of the royal society ( frs ) in <year> <year> : receives godman-salvin medal of the british ornithologists ' union 1962–1966 : president , international ornithological congress 1964–1965 : president , british ecological society <year> : awarded the darwin medal of the royal societythe centenary of lack 's birth , <integer> july <year> , was marked by a 'david lack centenary symposium ' , hosted by the edward grey institute . a programme of talks focused on and celebrated the scientific contributions of lack to ornithology , and the broader fields of ecology and evolution , and assessed the development of these fields in the 21st century . == personal life == david lack married elizabeth lack ( née silva ) who was also an ornithologist . elizabeth silva was born in hertfordshire in <year> and took an early interest in music . she wished to joined the royal academy of music in london but the war led to her serving in the auxiliary territorial service as an ambulance driver in europe . after the war she applied for work and due to her interest in birds she sent her resume to richard fitter who passed it on to david lack with a note `` here 's another for your reject file . '' lack however interviewed her and appointed her as a secretary . noting her interest in birds , he also invited her to serve as a field assistant for studies in the wytham woods . she also helped in the study of swifts . one day elizabeth did not return to her office after her observations of the swifts and david , worried that she might have fallen off a ladder , found her engrossed in observation . they became engaged in <year> and were married on july <days> , <year> . the best man was george varley . they had four children : peter lack ( born <year> , a biologist ) , andrew lack ( born <year> , also a biologist and academic ) , paul lack ( born <year> , a freelance teacher ) , and catherine lack ( born <year> , a university chaplain ) . in oxford , the lacks initially lived in a flat in park town , oxford , and later on boars hill , just south of oxford . lack enjoyed music and was also a fan of field hockey and tennis in which he also participated . lack died from non-hodgkin 's lymphoma despite radiation treatments . === religious beliefs === lack 's parents belonged to the church of england and he was an agnostic as an early adult but became a convert to anglicanism in <year> , possibly influenced by dan and mary neylan , friends at dartington hall . he sought to find a compromise between science and religion and wrote , in <year> , evolutionary theory and christian belief , on the relationship between christian faith and evolutionary theory . lack believed that evolution could not account for morality , truth , beauty , free will , self-awareness and individual responsibility . this book foreshadows , in some ways , the non-overlapping magisteria conception of the relationship between religion and science later popularised by stephen jay gould . arthur cain remarked of him `` david lack was the only religious man i knew at that period who did not allow his religion to dictate his view of natural selection .

michael werikhe ernest van den haag ( september <days> , <year> – march <days> , <year> ) was a dutch-born american sociologist , social critic , and author . he was john m. olin professor of jurisprudence and public policy at fordham university . he was best known for his contributions to national review . == life and career == ernest van den haag was born in <year> in the hague to moses “ max ” melamerson and flora haag melamerson . he changed his surname in the early 1940s . while van den haag was still young , his family moved to italy . van den haag grew up in italy , and following his education began a life in politics . in the late 1930s , he was a left-wing activist and communist . during this time , italy was ruled by benito mussolini 's fascist regime . in <year> , van den haag was nearly murdered by a political assassin who shot him five times . after being shot , he spent nearly three years in prison . nearly eighteen months of those three years were spent in solitary confinement . after release , fearing re-imprisonment , van den haag drifted between european countries in an attempt to evade italy and mussolini . in <year> , he made his way to portugal and fled to the united states , arriving at ellis island , not knowing any english . living in new york , van den haag worked as a bus boy and sold vegetables ; eventually he was able to secure admission to the university at iowa , where a group of faculty members recognized his intellectual gifts and agreed to pay for his tuition . in <year> , van den haag graduated with an m.a in economics . the same year , van den haag met the political philosopher sidney hook . his friendship with hook forever changed van den haag , converting him from being a left-wing activist and communist , to the opposite end of the spectrum ; van den haag was now a conservative . over the years , van den haag took particular interest in the field of capital punishment and the death penalty . his book punishing criminals : concerning a very old and painful question ( <year> ) developed his reputation on being one of the foremost thinkers and proponents on the death penalty . van den haag was considered by his colleagues to be an expert on the issue of capital punishment.van den haag died in mendham , new jersey . == on racial segregation in public schools == he was an early critic of the social science behind the supreme court 's decision in brown v. board of education which found segregation in schools unconstitutional , and testified in favor of segregation . he also argued in print that continued school segregation was desirable because of the genetic intellectual inferiority of africans . in an article in the pages of the national review , one given pride of place on the magazine 's front cover , van den haag dismissed recent research debunking innate ethnic differences in intelligence , and stated that he himself believed such differences to exist and to account for `` much '' of the poorer academic performance of black students , and that such differences necessitated separate schooling . this article in fact caused quite a shock among the readers of the national review , several of whom wrote angry letters against the decision to print such `` bigotry . '' in <year> , he testified before the international court of justice in support of apartheid in south africa . == on race-neutrality in u.s. immigration policy == in another article , from <year> , he criticized the immigration and nationality act of <year> , which replaced an immigration system largely excluding asians and discriminating against southern and eastern europeans with a race-neutral program based on skills and family connections to u.s. citizens and permanent residents , which enabled an increase in immigration from asia . van den haag instead advocated greater rather than less immigration restriction . he also expressly defended the practice of fashioning immigration policies in favor of european ethnicity , arguing that `` the wish to preserve ... the identity of one 's nation requires no justification . '' he likened such a practice to a harmless expression of sentiment , similar to preferring to associate with one 's own family rather than strangers . `` the wish not to see one 's country overrun by groups one regards as alien need not be based on feelings of superiority or 'racism . ' '' == on the death penalty == van den haag ’ s particular field of interest , the field he contributed the most to in terms of publications , was the death penalty . van den haag was a respected debater , and when he was not contributing to the national review or other publications , he was active in debating the issue of the death penalty . his main argument in its defense stemmed from key themes such as deterrence , and punishment for severe criminals.van den haag ’ s ideology is clearly conservative ; in his book punishing criminals , he defines the primary role of government as “ securing rights and duties by specifying them through laws and enforcing the laws. ” van den haag believed the paramount duty of government is to “ provide legal order in which citizens can be secure in their lives , their liberties , and their pursuit of happiness. ” the law exists to provide legal order . van den haag disputed claims that capital punishment is just a form of legal retribution by claiming that if laws are knowingly broken , legal order can only be maintained by enforcement . justice , van den haag claimed , is blindfolded , while retribution carries the weight of passion behind it ; justice being delivered to someone who violates social order knowingly is equal , thus the term legal retribution is void.van den haag also argued that people commit crimes because they believe , one way or another , they will benefit from committing the crime . thus it is society ’ s duty to make all crimes as disadvantageous as possible . van den haag uses economic examples to further prove his point . in economics , there is a concept named opportunity cost . opportunity cost forces an individual to weigh the benefits versus the sacrifices of making a decision . van den haag believes people look at committing the crime the same way they would view an opportunity ; they would weigh the profits versus the punishment . temptation to commit a crime will be significantly decreased if the punishment for committing the crime is more severe . the death penalty offers the greatest weighted punishment for committing an offense . van den haag also related marxist theory behind his justification of the death penalty . marxists , van den haag argued , believe that “ legal justice never can do less , though it can do more. ” legal justice should distribute punishment equally among violators and more frequently in order to deter crime . van den haag also related to the marxist belief in class warfare . van den haag states , “ obviously , the poor and powerless are more tempted to take what is not theirs , or to rebel , than the powerful and wealthy , who need not take what they already have. ” the threat of severe punishment diminishes temptation , which van den haag argued is to be the greatest use of the death penalty , deterrence . van den haag also believed that law breakers have more of an inclination to do it again . breaking the law leads to a form of moral decay when eventually offenders no longer can distinguish right from wrong , thus repeat offending is a common occurrence . his response to this was , “ the only permanent , and irrevocable incapacitation is execution. ” van den haag believed that any temporary or permanent incapacitation only reduces the crime rate if there are no more compensating increases in crime by other people . however , if no strong deterrents such as the death penalty existed , an increase in crime and criminals will still be a factor . van den haag believed homicide to be the most deplorable crime a human being can commit . van den haag , in his book the death penalty : a debate , argues that “ the state must teach that killing anyone deliberately , for whatever reason , is needless and wrong. ” van den haag believed that capital punishment has a direct correlation with a decrease in murders . rehabilitation as a response to murdering criminals is not an option because , as van den haag states , “ no effective method to achieve it [ rehabilitation ] has been found. ” if a proper method of rehabilitation can be found , it would not reduce the crime rate , because rehabilitation only works after the crime has been committed . deterrence is the only thing that can have any effect on the actual crime rate . overall , van den haag directed his argument toward the fact that the death penalty ought only to exist to protect innocent lives . to sum up his entire argument against his opposition in one quote , van den haag contends , “ i ’ d rather execute a man convicted of having murdered others than put the lives of innocents at risk . i find it hard to understand the opposite choice. ” van den haag recognized that innocent people would sometimes be executed . == literary works == throughout his life , ernest van den haag wrote many books and articles about society , and more specifically about capital punishment . his works include : the death penalty : a debate , <year> ( co-authored with john p. conrad ) the jewish mystique , <year> political violence and civil disobedience , <year> punishing criminals : concerning a very old and painful question , <year> == references == == external links == the war in katanga ;

however , inasmuch as he had become so knowledgeable about the soviet union and about economic planning , bettelheim was able to fill a gap . after world war ii , he became an official in the ministry of labor . in <year> he entered the `` sixth section '' [ <integer> ] of the école pratique des hautes études ( ephe ) . in the fifties , bettelheim began his international activities as an advisor to the governments of third world countries ; he was the spokesperson for gamal abdel nasser in egypt , for jawaharlal nehru in india , and for ahmed ben bella in algeria . in <year> , he created an institutional base for his research by founding the cemi . in <year> , che guevara invited him to cuba , where he participated in a `` grand debate '' on socialist economics . in <year> , bettelheim was particularly interested in china . he helped the union of young communists ( marxist–leninist ) with theoretical planning , without being directly affiliated with the organization . in his capacity as president of the franco-chinese friendship association ( association des amitiés franco-chinoises ) , he visited the people 's republic of china several times , in order to study new methods of industrial development created by the cultural revolution . after the death of mao zedong in <year> , bettelheim was very critical of the new leaders ( hua guofeng and deng xiaoping ) who began to abandon maoist principles , and replacing them with a politics of modernization which bettelheim considered reactionary and authoritarian . from <year> onward , bettelheim fell more and more by the wayside—a result of the profound political changes in the third world—and , in europe , of the decline ( and eventual dissolution ) of `` hard-line socialism '' , which rendered `` obsolete '' any debate over the paradigms of development in the southern countries , in an atmosphere of planned economy independent of the world market—an economy to which bettelheim had contributed so much . bettelheim has written a book of memoirs which has remained unfinished . until his death , bettelheim lived in paris . he did not publish anything in his later years . his student and long-time colleague bernard chavance is among the leading exponents of regulation theory . == thought == despite his negative experiences in moscow , bettelheim retained a favorable attitude towards soviet socialism until the sixties , citing the economic accomplishments of the soviet union , which he appreciated from an independent point of view . in <year> , he endorsed the de-stalinization inaugurated by nikita khrushchev at the twentieth congress of the soviet communist party , as well as the reforms conceived by soviet economist evsei liberman , suggesting a decentralization of decisions made within the planning leadership . === from the cuban debate to the critique of `` economism '' === in the cuban debate of <year> , bettelheim was opposed to the voluntarist ideas of che guevara , who wanted to abolish free market and the production of merchandise through a very rapid and centralized industrialization , morally mobilizing `` the new man . '' bettelheim took a position against this plan , to which fidel castro had also subscribed : both che guevara and castro preferred the monoculture of sugar as the basis of cuban economy , rather than a strict analogy to the economy of the soviet union . in cuba , bettelheim recommended a diversified economy , based on agriculture , prudent industrialization , broad central planning , mixed forms of property ownership with market elements—a pragmatic strategy similar to the `` new economic policy '' begun in russia by vladimir lenin in <year> . opposing guevara , bettelheim argued ( in line with the last writings of stalin ) that the `` law of value '' was the manifestation of objective social conditions which could not be overcome by willful decisions , but only by a process of long-term social transformation . this debate demonstrated the profound differences which , from then on , separated bettelheim from marxist `` orthodoxy '' , which considered socialism as the result of `` the development of maximum centralization of all forces of industrial production '' . for bettelheim , socialism is rather an alternative voice in development ; a process of transformation of social understandings . inspired by the chinese cultural revolution and the thought of mao zedong , and in cooperation with the marxist philosopher louis althusser , bettelheim was opposed to `` economism '' and to the `` primacy of the means of production '' of traditional marxism : against the idea that socialist transformation of social bonds was a necessary effect of the development of the forces of production ( liberating those bonds from them , according to marxist orthodoxy , since private property dominates them in `` bourgeois '' society ) , he affirmed the necessity for actively and politically transforming social connections . in his book economic calculations and forms of ownership ( calcul économique et formes de proprieté ) , bettelheim re-thinks the problems of transition to socialism , while criticizing the supposition that nationalization and state ownership of the means of production was already `` socialist '' —it is not the legal form of property , but true socialization of the web of production , which characterizes such a transition ; the crucial problem in socialist planning is the replacement of the form of `` value '' with the development of a method of measurement which takes into account the social utility of production . === chinese experience and analysis of the soviet union === in china , bettelheim had the impression that he was in the process of witnessing just such a process of transformation . more specifically , he noted that the cultural revolution—a revolution of the political , ideological and cultural superstructure—changed the industrial organization accompanying it by a general participation by the workers in all decisions , and overcoming the division of `` manual '' and `` intellectual '' labor . during these years , china was the benchmark for the neo-marxist `` radical school of economics '' , represented by bettelheim , paul sweezy , andre gunder frank , samir amin and others who , by fighting against theories of `` modernization , '' affirmed that at the periphery of the worldwide capitalist system , in `` under-developed '' countries , `` development '' is only possible under conditions where these countries pry themselves free from their unequal and asymmetrical connections with the world market , dominated by imperialist countries , in order to choose a different and autonomous path : a development of production neither for profit , nor for an accumulation of abstract wealth , but for the needs of the people . under the banner of such a `` maoist '' approach , bettelheim began his voluminous work on the history of the soviet union : les luttes de classes en urss ( 1974–1982 ) ( class struggle in the ussr ( 1974–1982 ) ) , where he examines the reasons for the distortions of soviet socialism , which , according to bettelheim , is nothing more than a `` state capitalism . '' bettelheim showed that after the october revolution , the bolsheviks had not succeeded in any long-term stabilization of the alliance between workers and poor peasants which had earlier been conceived by lenin . during the 1920s , this alliance was replaced by an alliance of elite workers and technological intellectuals against the peasants , culminating in the forced collectivization of agriculture in <year> . `` economistic '' ideology ( the `` primacy of the forces of production '' ) , born in social-democracy and fed by the interests of the `` worker aristocracy '' and progressivist intellectuals , was resurrected by the enablement of the bolshevik party , acting as a legitimization of new technocratic elites which established the same divisions of labor and social differentiations , as had capitalism . however , the `` legal '' mirage , according to which the property of the state is defined as `` socialist , '' hides the actual exploitation . finally , bettelheim called into doubt the socialist character of the october revolution , interpreting it as a seizing of power by a radical branch of the russian intelligentsia , which `` confiscated '' a popular revolution.bettelheim was a leading proponent of the thesis that `` development '' in the countries of the `` third world '' necessitates a political break with imperialism and a distantanglement from the bonds of dependency on the unequal international division of labor of the world market . this position also includes a sharp criticism of the international role of the soviet union whose politics of development bettelheim saw as just another variant of capitalist accumulation models . this theory saw a chance for a disentanglement of the political groundwork in order to practice an alternative development model , one that was not oriented towards accumulation and profit , but rather towards an economy for the everyday needs of the people , with a balanced proportion allowed between agriculture and industry . === decline of the marxist environment === when , in <year> , the people 's republic of china , under the leadership of deng xiaoping , put paid to the `` maoist '' strategy of autarkic ( tr . note : independent and self-sustaining ) development , guided by political priorities , in order to reaffirm the primacy of the economy and to introduce itself into the world market , the theoreticians ' paradigm of autonomous development lost the force of its convictions . at the same time , marxism lost its influence , especially in france , where a wave of anti-communism succeeded in discrediting not only the `` archaeo-communist '' orthodoxy , but also marxist critics such as bettelheim . bettelheim , who had never abandoned marxist thinking , was condemned to disappear . in <year> , he published the two volumes of the third part of class struggle in the ussr , dedicated to the `` dominated '' and `` dominators '' of stalinism , but the marxist environment , in which bettelheim had been rooted before , had dissolved . == publications == la planification soviétique . rivière , <year> ( soviet planning ) l'économie allemande sous le nazisme ,

russian : александр давидович надирадзе <integer> august <year> – <integer> september <year> ) was a soviet inventor , designer and engineer in the fields of aircraft and missile/rocket technology . he developed various missiles , bombs , shells and is considered `` father '' of the mobile icbms , having created the <other> temp 2s ( <other> ) , <other> pioneer ( <other> ) and the <other> topol ( <other> ) . more modern weapons such as the <other> topol-m and <other> are mostly based on nadiradze 's work as well . == early life and career == born on <integer> august <days> or <integer> september <days> in <year> in the town of gori , georgia , nadiradze was raised in a teacher 's family in tbilisi . initially working as an assistant in a small georgian aerospace faculty , he made his first invention <days> may <year> . after finishing at the transcaucasian industrial institute in <year> he moved to moscow and applied to the moscow aviation institute . two years later nadiradze began working in the central aerohydrodynamic institute ( tsagi ) in which he led a team of engineers engaged in theoretical and experimental research of aircraft landing gears based on the principles of air cushions . he was also involved in the development of the tupolev <other> and early soviet turbojet fighters . in <year> he was appointed a chief designer in the moscow okb ( experimental design bureau ) plant <integer> ( gorbunov ) . == missile technology == at the end of <year> nadiradze started his work in the field of rocket design . during the world war ii he developed five versions of anti-tank shells , one of which had satisfactory results . in <year> he got appointed chief designer and chief of the bureau of the faculty of missile weapons moscow mechanical institute of the people 's commissariat of ammunition , functioning as experienced okb guide holding lectures on the production and designing of missiles and launchers , while simultaneously conducting research on two-stage rockets and turbojets . in <year> the council of ministers of the ussr transferred the moscow okb institute to <other> minelhozmasha and nadiradze took command over a division which was developing unguided anti-aircraft missiles and anti-tank rockets . in <year> he developed the soviet anti-air missile system `` swift '' and a year later the new <other> was incorporated into gsnii <other> , which basically merged diverse design bureaus working on cruise missiles , powder and radio-controlled bombs into one institute . in <year> nadiradze took charge of project `` raven '' . his experience was used to create the world 's first high altitude meteorological rocket , development of which technically began back in <year> at the central aerological observatory hydrometeorological service of the ussr . the rocket was designed to deliver `` instruments '' into stratosphere . his involvement was of high importance since the first soviet meteorological rocket <other> meteo which was successfully launched in <year> was also developed by alexander nadiradze himself . on <integer> october the same year he would be tasked with the development of the so-called `` tshaika '' radio-controlled bombs ( <other> ) . tests were successfully completed in <year> and the new weapon was accepted for service later that year . in late <year> moscow gsnii <other> was combined with reutov <other> chelomey . nadiradze was appointed the head of chelomey 's secret development section and in <year> took charge of the entire okb , while remaining a chief designer . by decision of the soviet government and defense ministry a competition for designing a mobile intercontinental ballistic missile ( icbm ) was organized and alexander nadiradze 's team won . he became the founder of the soviet mobile intercontinental ballistic missile forces . on <integer> march <year> the defence ministry gave order to develop a mobile solid fuel icbm . the project was named `` <other> '' which would then become the <other> temp 2s . on <integer> march <year> testing of `` <other> '' started at the state rvsn ( plesetsk cosmodrome ) in the arkhangelsk region . tests were completed <days> december <year> . this secret launch site was under command of the fellow georgian lt.general galaktion alpaidze who was in charge of the soviet missile program and from <year> was also a deputy director of the moscow institute for thermal technology . on <integer> february <year> two missile regiments of <other> started their combat duty in plesetsk . prior to that nadiradze had already created the <other> pioneer in <year> which was based on his earlier works on the <other> . its flight tests went exceptionally well and were completed on <integer> january <year> . the mobile missile complex pioneer was adopted and started its service from <integer> march <days> the same year . his pioneer would become the base for the later topol missile . for his third great achievement in soviet missile technology nadiradze was awarded hero of socialist labour ( gold medal with hammer and sickle ) and order of lenin . he then developed a heavily improved pioneer-utth ( nato 's designation <other> mod <integer> ) which would deliver warheads with three 5–50 kt mirvs . the new system was adopted by soviet strategic missile forces on <integer> april <year> . on <integer> december <year> nadiradze was elected a full member ( academician ) of the ussr academy of science in the department of mechanics and control processes ( theoretical and applied mechanics , mechanical engineering and engineering science ) . he was also awarded second hero of socialist labour and fourth order of lenin by presidium of ussr supreme soviet . when secretary general mikhail gorbachev and u.s. president reagan signed the intermediate to short-range missiles treaty on <integer> december <year> , the ussr had to destroy <integer> of its pioneer missile complexes . the <other> topol whose development started by nadiradze in <year> , was put into active service in <year> , and to this day remains a primary nuclear strike capability of the russian federation . the main challenge of the topol project was to create a suitable battle management system , which was nadiradze 's main focus throughout the entire development . for this last project , nadiradze received the ussr state prize in <year> . his work was continued after his death by boris n. lapygin . this last achievement in mobile icbms stemmed from alexandre nadiradze 's very first inventions . he wrote over <integer> articles in scientific journals and registered over <integer> inventions and operating guidelines . his work would prove to be vital for subsequent developments . he principally established a scientific base for missile systems which would be used by his followers and successors . == awards == lenin prize ( <year> ) four times order of lenin ( <year> , <year> , <year> , <year> ) doctor of technical science ( <year> ) professor ( <year> ) honoured inventor of the rsfsr ( <year> ) order of the red banner ( <year> ) two times hero of socialist labour ( <year> and <year> ) order of the

nadiradze . on the backside of the medal a mobile icbm launcher is engraved.commemorative plaques in honor of a.d nadiradze are installed in front of the main building of the same institutes . == death == nadiradze lived and worked in moscow until his death on <integer> september <year> . he is buried at the novodevichy cemetery in moscow ( section <integer> ) . on the tombstone nadiradze is portrayed holding a sheet of paper in his hands , conveying his zeal for inventions and his dedication to his work . == references == == external links == « красная звезда » from <integer> august

<year> . he is internationally renowned for his pioneering research on economic theory , particularly in the areas of mechanism and institutional design and mathematical economics . in the 1950s , he worked with kenneth arrow on non-linear programming ; in <year> arrow became the youngest person to receive the nobel economics prize . hurwicz was the graduate advisor to daniel mcfadden , who received the prize in 2000.earlier economists often avoided analytic modeling of economic institutions . hurwicz 's work was instrumental in showing how economic models can provide a framework for the analysis of systems , such as capitalism and socialism , and how the incentives in such systems affect members of society . the theory of incentive compatibility that hurwicz developed changed the way many economists thought about outcomes , explaining why centrally planned economies may fail and how incentives for individuals make a difference in decision making.hurwicz served on the editorial board of several journals . he co-edited and contributed to two collections for cambridge university press : studies in resource allocation processes ( <year> , with kenneth arrow ) and social goals

universität bielefeld ( <year> ) . he was an honorary visiting professor of the huazhong university of science and technology school of economics ( <year> ) . === named for hurwicz === first presented in <year> , the hurwicz criterion is thought about to this day in the area of decision making called `` under uncertainty . '' abraham wald published decision functions that year . hurwicz combined wald 's ideas with work done in <year> by pierre-simon laplace . hurwicz 's criterion gives each decision a value which is `` a weighted sum of its worst and best possible outcomes '' represented as α and known as an index of pessimism or optimism . variations have been proposed ever since and some corrections came very soon from leonard jimmie savage in <year> . these four approaches– laplace , wald , hurwicz and savage– have been studied , corrected and applied for over fifty years by many different people including john milnor , g. l. s. shackle , daniel ellsberg , r. duncan luce and howard raiffa , in a field some date back to jacob bernoulli.in <year> , the college of liberal arts at the university of minnesota launched the heller-hurwicz economics institute , a global initiative created to inform public policy by supporting and promoting frontier economic research and by communicating findings to leading academics , policymakers , and business executives around the world . funds raised by the institute are used to attract and retain preeminent faculty and , in part , to support graduate student research . the university of michigan has an endowed chair named for hurwicz , the leonid hurwicz collegiate professor of complex systems , political science , and economics , currently held by scott e. page . the leonid hurwicz distinguished lecture is given to the minnesota economic association ( as is the heller lecture ) . john ledyard ( <year> ) , robert lucas , roger myerson , edward c. prescott , james quirk , nancy stokey and neil wallace are among those who have delivered the lecture since it was inaugurated in <year> . === nobel prize in economics === <days> october <year> , hurwicz shared the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences with eric maskin of the institute for advanced study and roger myerson of the university of chicago `` for having laid the foundations of mechanism design theory . '' during a telephone interview , a representative of the nobel foundation told hurwicz and his wife that hurwicz was the oldest person to win the nobel prize . hurwicz said , `` i hope that others who deserve it also got it . '' when asked which of all the applications of mechanism design he was most pleased to see he said welfare economics . the winners applied game theory , a field advanced by mathematician john forbes nash , to discover the best and most efficient means to reach a desired outcome , taking into account individuals ' knowledge and self-interest , which may <days> hidden or private . mechanism design has been used to model negotiations and taxation , voting and elections , to design auctions such as those for communications bandwidth , elections and labor talks and for pricing stock options.unable to attend the nobel prize ceremony in stockholm because of his poor health , hurwicz received the prize in minneapolis . accompanied by evelyn , his spouse of six decades , and his family , he was the guest of honor at a convocation held on the campus of the university of minnesota presided over by university president robert bruininks . immediately following a live broadcast of the nobel prize awards ceremony , jonas hafström , swedish ambassador to the united states , personally awarded the economics prize to professor hurwicz . == publications == hurwicz , leonid <days> december <year> ) . `` the theory of economic behavior '' . the american economic review . american economic association via jstor . <integer> ( <integer> ) : 909–925 . jstor <integer> . exposition on game theory classic . hurwicz , leonid <days> april <year> ) . `` theory of the firm and of investment '' . econometrica . the econometric society via jstor . <integer> ( <integer> ) : 109–136 . <other> . jstor <integer> . hurwicz , leonid <days> july <year> ) . `` some problems arising in estimating economic relations '' . econometrica . the econometric society via jstor . <integer> ( <integer> ) : 236–240 . <other> . jstor <integer> . hurwicz , leonid ; arrow , kenneth j .

domestic . from <year> to <year> , he attended loyola college . == career == after serving as director of the school of commerce at mcgill university and president of the montreal stock exchange , kierans entered provincial politics in <year> . nicknamed the `` socialist millionaire , '' he was appointed minister of revenue and then minister of health in the quebec liberal government of quebec premier jean lesage during the quiet revolution . kierans became president of the quebec liberal party and clashed with former cabinet minister and colleague rené lévesque in <year> , daring him to give up the idea of quebec separatism or quit the liberal party . lévesque later quit the liberal party and established the mouvement souveraineté-association , which became quebec 's leading sovereigntist party as the parti québécois . initially a critic of walter l. gordon 's economic nationalism , kierans ' experience in government changed his mind , and he became a believer in the need for state intervention in the economy . in <year> , kierans entered federal politics running unsuccessfully for the leadership of the liberal party of canada at its <year> leadership convention . he was elected to the house of commons in the <year> federal election . kierans served as postmaster-general and minister of communications in the cabinet of prime minister pierre trudeau . he did not run for re-election in the <year> election , partly as a result of his criticisms of trudeau 's economic policy . kierans called for canada to leave the north atlantic treaty organization ( nato ) in <year> . he argued that the organization might have served a useful purpose on its initial formation but had since become anachronistic . some others with the trudeau government agreed with kierans , but others strongly disagreed . the trudeau government ultimately kept canada in nato but reduced canada 's troop deployment . he considered running for the leadership of the new democratic party in <year> but declined in favour of ed broadbent . after leaving politics , kierans taught at mcgill and dalhousie university . in the 1980s , he became a familiar voice appearing with dalton camp and stephen lewis as part of a weekly political panel on peter gzowski 's canadian broadcasting corporation radio show , morningside . in <year> , he was made an officer of the order of canada . ==

more accessible to non-specialists . he was married to the psychoanalyst helen block lewis ( 1913–1987 ) , and they had two children , john block lewis and judith lewis herman , a physician who followed in her mother 's professional footsteps . == early studies == lewis did his undergraduate studies in classical languages and french at city college of new york ( ab , magna cum laude <year> ) and earned an ma at columbia ( <year> ) . he generally found the lectures rather mechanical but his curiosity in what was to become the object of a lifelong research interest was stirred where he did course work in his final year , when he read , together with meyer reinhold and moses finkelstein , the zenon papyri under the direction of william linn westermann . == europe , 1933–1936 == lewis pursued further postgraduate studies in europe with a fellowship from the american field service . after receiving a certificate at the university of strasbourg ( <year> ) , he went to paris where he pursued his studies on papyrology under paul collart , and more generally , trained as an historian under gustave glotz . his first work , a doctoral thesis in french , was l'industrie du papyrus dans l'égypte gréco-romaine ( paris , <year> ) , a study of the papyrus plant and how it was manufactured and used for writing . he published an english version of his thesis much later in <year> under the

[ <integer> ] === citations === == external links == naphtali lewis at the database of classical scholars == references == carl edward sagan ( ; say-gən ; november <days> , <year> – december <days> , <year> ) was an american astronomer , planetary scientist , cosmologist , astrophysicist , astrobiologist , author , and science communicator . his best known scientific contribution is research on extraterrestrial life , including experimental demonstration of the production of amino acids from basic chemicals by radiation . sagan assembled the first physical messages sent into space , the pioneer plaque and the voyager golden record , universal messages that could potentially be understood by any extraterrestrial intelligence that might find them . sagan argued the hypothesis , accepted since , that the high surface temperatures of venus can be attributed to , and calculated using , the greenhouse effect . he testified to the us congress in <year> that the greenhouse effect will change the earth 's climate system.initially an associate professor at harvard , sagan later moved to cornell where he would spend the majority of his career as the david duncan professor of astronomy and space sciences . sagan published more than <integer> scientific papers and articles and was author , co-author or editor of more than <integer> books . he wrote many popular science books , such as the dragons of eden , broca 's brain , pale blue dot and narrated and co-wrote the award-winning <year> television series cosmos : a personal voyage . the most widely watched series in the history of american public television , cosmos , has been seen by at least <integer> million people in <integer> countries . the book cosmos was published to accompany the series . he also wrote the <year> science fiction novel contact , the basis for a <year> film of the same name . his papers , containing 595,000 items , are archived at the library of congress.sagan advocated scientific skeptical inquiry and the scientific method , pioneered exobiology and promoted the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence ( seti ) . he spent most of his career as a professor of astronomy at cornell university , where he directed the laboratory for planetary studies . sagan and his works received numerous awards and honors , including the nasa distinguished public service medal , the national academy of sciences public welfare medal , the pulitzer prize for general non-fiction for his book the dragons of eden , and , regarding cosmos : a personal voyage , two emmy awards , the peabody award , and the hugo award . he married three times and had five children . after suffering from myelodysplasia , sagan died of pneumonia at the age of <integer> , on december <days> , <year> . == early life and education == sagan was born in the bensonhurst neighborhood of brooklyn , new york on november <days> , <year> . his father , samuel sagan , was an immigrant garment worker from kamianets-podilskyi , then in the russian empire , in today 's ukraine . his mother , rachel molly gruber , was a housewife from new york . carl was named in honor of rachel 's biological mother , chaiya clara , in sagan 's words , `` the mother she never knew '' , because she died while giving birth to her second child . rachel 's father remarried to a woman named rose . according to carol ( carl 's sister ) , rachel `` never accepted rose as her mother . she knew she was n't her birth mother ... she was a rather rebellious child and young adult ... 'emancipated woman ' , we 'd call her now . `` the family lived in a modest apartment near the atlantic ocean , in bensonhurst , a brooklyn neighborhood . according to sagan , they were reform jews , the most liberal of north american judaism 's four main groups . carl and his sister agreed that their father was not especially religious , but that their mother `` definitely believed in god , and was active in the temple ; ... and served only kosher meat '' . : <integer> during the depths of the depression , his father worked as a theater usher . : <integer> according to biographer keay davidson , sagan 's `` inner war '' was a result of his close relationship with both of his parents , who were in many ways `` opposites '' . sagan traced his later analytical urges to his mother , a woman who had been extremely poor as a child in new york city during world war i and the 1920s . : <integer> as a young woman , she had held her own intellectual ambitions , but they were frustrated by social restrictions : her poverty , her status as a woman and a wife , and her jewish ethnicity . davidson notes that she therefore `` worshipped her only son , carl . he would fulfill her unfulfilled dreams . `` : <integer> however , he claimed that his sense of wonder came from his father , who in his free time gave apples to the poor or helped soothe labor-management tensions within new york 's garment industry . : <integer> although he was awed by carl 's intellectual abilities , he took his son 's inquisitiveness in stride and saw it as part of his growing up . : <integer> in his later years as a writer and scientist , sagan would often draw on his childhood memories to illustrate scientific points , as he did in his book shadows of forgotten ancestors . : <integer> sagan describes his parents ' influence on his later thinking : my parents were not scientists . they knew almost nothing about science . but in introducing me simultaneously to skepticism and to wonder , they taught me the two uneasily cohabiting modes of thought that are central to the scientific method . sagan recalls that one of his most defining moments was when his parents took him to the <year> new york world 's fair when he was four years old . the exhibits became a turning point in his life . he later recalled the moving map of the america of tomorrow exhibit : `` it showed beautiful highways and cloverleaves and little general motors cars all carrying people to skyscrapers , buildings with lovely spires , flying buttresses—and it looked great ! `` : <integer> at other exhibits , he remembered how a flashlight that shone on a photoelectric cell created a crackling sound , and how the sound from a tuning fork became a wave on an oscilloscope . he also witnessed the future media technology that would replace radio : television . sagan wrote : : <integer> plainly , the world held wonders of a kind i had never guessed . how could a tone become a picture and light become a noise ? he also saw one of the fair 's most publicized events , the burial of a time capsule at flushing meadows , which contained mementos of the 1930s to be recovered by earth 's descendants in a future millennium . `` the time capsule thrilled carl '' , writes davidson . as an adult , sagan and his colleagues would create similar time capsules—capsules that would be sent out into the galaxy ; these were the pioneer plaque and the voyager golden record précis , all of which were spinoffs of sagan 's memories of the world 's fair . : <integer> during world war ii sagan 's family worried about the fate of their european relatives . sagan , however , was generally unaware of the details of the ongoing war . he wrote , `` sure , we had relatives who were caught up in the holocaust . hitler was not a popular fellow in our household ... but on the other hand , i was fairly insulated from the horrors of the war . '' his sister , carol , said that their mother `` above all wanted to protect carl ... she had an extraordinarily difficult time dealing with world war ii and the holocaust . `` : <integer> sagan 's book the demon-haunted world ( <year> ) included his memories of this conflicted period , when his family dealt with the realities of the war in europe but tried to prevent it from undermining his optimistic spirit . === inquisitiveness about nature === soon after entering elementary school he began to express a strong inquisitiveness about nature . sagan recalled taking his first trips to the public library alone , at the age of five , when his mother got him a library card . he wanted to learn what stars were , since none of his friends or their parents could give him a clear answer : : <integer> i went to the librarian and asked for a book about stars ; ... and the answer was stunning . it was that the sun was a star but really close . the stars were suns , but so far away they were just little points of light ... the scale of the universe suddenly opened up to me . it was a kind of religious experience . there was a magnificence to it , a grandeur , a scale which has never left me . never ever left me . at about age six or seven , he and a close friend took trips to the american museum of natural history across the east river in manhattan . while there , they went to the hayden planetarium and walked around the museum 's exhibits of space objects , such as meteorites , and displays of dinosaurs and animals in natural settings . sagan writes about those visits : : <integer> i was transfixed by the dioramas—lifelike representations of animals and their habitats all over the world . penguins on the dimly lit antarctic ice ; ... a family of gorillas , the male beating his chest , ... an american grizzly bear standing on his hind legs , ten or twelve feet tall , and staring me right in the eye . his parents helped nurture his growing interest in science by buying him chemistry sets and reading materials . his interest in space , however , was his primary focus , especially after reading science fiction stories by writers such as h. g. wells and edgar rice burroughs , which stirred his imagination about life on other planets such as mars . according to biographer ray spangenburg , these early years as sagan tried to understand the mysteries of the planets became a `` driving force in his life , a continual spark to his intellect , and a quest that would never be forgotten '' .in <year> he discovered astounding science fiction magazine , which introduced him to more hard science fiction speculations than those in burroughs 's novels . that same year inaugurated the `` flying saucer '' mass hysteria with the young carl suspecting that the `` discs '' might be alien spaceships . === high-school years === sagan had lived in bensonhurst , where he went to david a. boody junior high school . he had his bar mitzvah in bensonhurst when he turned 13. : <integer> the following year , <year> , his family moved to the town of rahway , new jersey , for his father 's work , where sagan then entered rahway high school . he graduated in 1951. : <integer> rahway was an older semi-industrial town . : <integer> sagan was a straight-a student but was bored due to unchallenging classes and uninspiring teachers . : <integer> his teachers realized this and tried to convince his parents to send him to a private school , the administrator telling them , `` this kid ought to go to a school for gifted children , he has something really remarkable . `` : <integer> however , his parents could not afford it . sagan was made president of the school 's chemistry club , and at home he set up his own laboratory . he taught himself about molecules by making cardboard cutouts to help him visualize how molecules were formed : `` i found that about as interesting as doing [ chemical ] experiments , '' he said . : <integer> sagan remained mostly interested in astronomy as a hobby and in his junior year made it a career goal after he learned that astronomers were paid for doing what he always enjoyed : `` that was a splendid day—when i began to suspect that if i tried hard i could do astronomy full-time , not just part-time . `` : <integer> before the end of high school , he entered an essay contest in which he posed the question of whether human contact with advanced life forms from another planet might be as disastrous for people on earth as it was for native americans when they first had contact with europeans . the subject was considered controversial , but his rhetorical skill won over the judges , and they awarded him first prize . by graduation , his classmates had voted him `` most likely to succeed '' and put him in line to be valedictorian . === university education === sagan attended the university of chicago , which was one of the few colleges he applied to that would , despite his excellent high-school grades , consider admitting a <other> . its chancellor , robert maynard hutchins , had recently retooled the undergraduate college of the university of chicago into an `` ideal meritocracy '' built on great books , socratic dialogue , comprehensive examinations and early entrance to college with no age requirement . the school also employed a number of the nation 's leading scientists , including enrico fermi and edward teller , along with operating the famous yerkes observatory.during his time as an honors program undergraduate , sagan worked in the laboratory of the geneticist h. j. muller and wrote a thesis on the origins of life with physical chemist harold urey . sagan joined the ryerson astronomical society , received a b.a . degree in laughingly self-proclaimed `` nothing '' with general and special honors in <year> , and a b.s . degree in physics in <year> . he went on to earn a m.s . degree in physics in <year> , before earning a phd degree in <year> with his thesis physical studies of the planets submitted to the department of astronomy and astrophysics.he used the summer months of his graduate studies to work with his dissertation director , planetary scientist gerard kuiper , as well as physicist george gamow and chemist melvin calvin . the title of sagan 's dissertation reflects his shared interests with kuiper , who throughout the 1950s had been president of the international astronomical union 's commission on `` physical studies of planets and satellites '' . in <year> , the two worked on the classified military project a119 , the secret air force plan to detonate a nuclear warhead on the moon.sagan had a top secret clearance at the u.s. air force and a secret clearance with nasa . while working on his doctoral dissertation , sagan revealed us government classified titles of two project a119 papers when he applied for a university of california , berkeley scholarship in <year> . the leak was not publicly revealed until <year> , when it was published in the journal nature . a follow-up letter to the journal by project leader leonard reiffel confirmed sagan 's security leak . == career and research == from <year> to <year> sagan was a miller fellow at the university of california , berkeley . meanwhile , he published an article in <year> in the journal science on the atmosphere of venus , while also working with nasa 's mariner <integer> team , and served as a `` planetary sciences consultant '' to the rand corporation.after the publication of sagan 's science article , in <year> harvard university astronomers fred whipple and donald menzel offered sagan the opportunity to give a colloquium at harvard and subsequently offered him a lecturer position at the institution . sagan instead asked to be made an assistant professor , and eventually whipple and menzel were able to convince harvard to offer sagan the assistant professor position he requested . sagan lectured , performed research , and advised graduate students at the institution from <year> until <year> , as well as working at the smithsonian astrophysical observatory , also located in cambridge , massachusetts . in <year> , sagan was denied tenure at harvard . he later indicated that the decision was very much unexpected . the tenure denial has been blamed on several factors , including that he focused his interests too broadly across a number of areas ( while the norm in academia is to become a renowned expert in a narrow specialty ) , and perhaps because of his well-publicized scientific advocacy , which some scientists perceived as borrowing the ideas of others for little more than self-promotion . an advisor from his years as an undergraduate student , harold urey , wrote a letter to the tenure committee recommending strongly against tenure for sagan . long before the ill-fated tenure process , cornell university astronomer thomas gold had courted sagan to move to ithaca , new york , and join the faculty at cornell . following the denial of tenure from harvard , sagan accepted gold 's offer and remained a faculty member at cornell for nearly <integer> years until his death in <year> . unlike harvard , the smaller and more laid-back astronomy department at cornell welcomed sagan 's growing celebrity status . following two years as an associate professor , sagan became a full professor at cornell in <year> and directed the laboratory for planetary studies there . from <year> to <year> , he was associate director of the center for radiophysics and space research ( crsr ) at cornell . in <year> , he became the david duncan professor of astronomy and space sciences , a position he held for the remainder of his life.sagan was associated with the u.s. space program from its inception . from the 1950s onward , he worked as an advisor to nasa , where one of his duties included briefing the apollo astronauts before their flights to the moon . sagan contributed to many of the robotic spacecraft missions that explored the solar system , arranging experiments on many of the expeditions . sagan assembled the first physical message that was sent into space : a gold-plated plaque , attached to the space probe pioneer <integer> , launched in <year> . pioneer <integer> , also carrying another copy of the plaque , was launched the following year . he continued to refine his designs ; the most elaborate message he helped to develop and assemble was the voyager golden record , which was sent out with the voyager space probes in <year> . sagan often challenged the decisions to fund the space shuttle and the international space station at the expense of further robotic missions . === scientific achievements === former student david morrison described sagan as `` an 'idea person ' and a master of intuitive physical arguments and 'back of the envelope ' calculations '' , and gerard kuiper said that `` some persons work best in specializing on a major program in the laboratory ; others are best in liaison between sciences . dr. sagan belongs in the latter group . `` sagan 's contributions were central to the discovery of the high surface temperatures of the planet venus . in the early 1960s no one knew for certain the basic conditions of venus ' surface , and sagan listed the possibilities in a report later depicted for popularization in a time life book planets . his own view was that venus was dry and very hot as opposed to the balmy paradise others had imagined . he had investigated radio waves from venus and concluded that there was a surface temperature of <integer> °c ( <integer> °f ) . as a visiting scientist to nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory , he contributed to the first mariner missions to venus , working on the design and management of the project . mariner <integer> confirmed his conclusions on the surface conditions of venus in <year> . sagan was among the first to hypothesize that saturn 's moon titan might possess oceans of liquid compounds on its surface and that jupiter 's moon europa might possess subsurface oceans of water . this would make europa potentially habitable . europa 's subsurface ocean of water was later indirectly confirmed by the spacecraft galileo . the mystery of titan 's reddish haze was also solved with sagan 's help . the reddish haze was revealed to be due to complex organic molecules constantly raining down onto titan 's surface.sagan further contributed insights regarding the atmospheres of venus and jupiter , as well as seasonal changes on mars . he also perceived global warming as a growing , man-made danger and likened it to the natural development of venus into a hot , life-hostile planet through a kind of runaway greenhouse effect . sagan and his cornell colleague edwin ernest salpeter speculated about life in jupiter 's clouds , given the planet 's dense atmospheric composition rich in organic molecules . he studied the observed color variations on mars ' surface and concluded that they were not seasonal or vegetational changes as most believed , but shifts in surface dust caused by windstorms . sagan is also known for his research on the possibilities of extraterrestrial life , including experimental demonstration of the production of amino acids from basic chemicals by radiation.he is also the <year> recipient of the public welfare medal , the highest award of the national academy of sciences for `` distinguished contributions in the application of science to the public welfare '' . he was denied membership in the academy , reportedly because his media activities made him unpopular with many other scientists.as of <year> , sagan is the most cited seti scientist and one of the most cited planetary scientists . === cosmos : popularizing science on tv === in <year> sagan co-wrote and narrated the award-winning <other> pbs television series cosmos : a personal voyage , which became the most widely watched series in the history of american public television until <year> . the show has been seen by at least <integer> million people across <integer> countries . the book , cosmos , written by sagan , was published to accompany the series.because of his earlier popularity as a science writer from his best-selling books , including the dragons of eden , which won him a pulitzer prize in <year> , he was asked to write and narrate the show . it was targeted to a general audience of viewers , whom sagan felt had lost interest in science , partly due to a stifled educational system.each of the <integer> episodes was created to focus on a particular subject or person , thereby demonstrating the synergy of the universe . they covered a wide range of scientific subjects including the origin of life and a perspective of humans ' place on earth . the show won an emmy , along with a peabody award , and transformed sagan from an obscure astronomer into a pop-culture icon . time magazine ran a cover story about sagan soon after the show broadcast , referring to him as `` creator , chief writer and host-narrator of the show '' . in <year> , `` cosmos '' was released on a remastered set of dvds . === `` billions and billions '' === sagan was invited to frequent appearances on the tonight show starring johnny carson . after cosmos aired , he became associated with the catchphrase `` billions and billions , '' although he never actually used the phrase in the cosmos series . he rather used the term `` billions upon billions . '' carson , however , would sometimes use the phrase during his parodies of sagan . ==== sagan unit ==== as a humorous tribute to sagan and his association with the catchphrase `` billions and billions '' , a sagan has been defined as a unit of measurement equivalent to a very large number – technically at least four billion ( two billion plus two billion ) – of anything . === sagan 's number === sagan 's number is the number of stars in the observable universe . this number is reasonably well defined , because it is known what stars are and what the observable universe is , but its value is highly uncertain . in <year> , sagan estimated it to be <integer> sextillion in short scale ( <year> ) . in <year> , it was estimated to be <integer> sextillion ( <integer> × <year> ) . in <year> , it was estimated to be <integer> sextillion ( <integer> × <year> ) . === scientific and critical thinking advocacy === sagan 's ability to convey his ideas allowed many people to understand the cosmos better—simultaneously emphasizing the value and worthiness of the human race , and the relative insignificance of the earth in comparison to the universe . he delivered the <year> series of royal institution christmas lectures in london.sagan was a proponent of the search for extraterrestrial life . he urged the scientific community to listen with radio telescopes for signals from potential intelligent extraterrestrial life-forms . sagan was so persuasive that by <year> he was able to get a petition advocating seti published in the journal science , signed by <integer> scientists , including seven nobel prize winners . this signaled a tremendous increase in the respectability of a then-controversial field . sagan also helped frank drake write the arecibo message , a radio message beamed into space from the arecibo radio telescope on november <days> , <year> , aimed at informing potential extraterrestrials about earth . sagan was chief technology officer of the professional planetary research journal icarus for <integer> years . he co-founded the planetary society and was a member of the seti institute board of trustees . sagan served as chairman of the division for planetary science of the american astronomical society , as president of the planetology section of the american geophysical union , and as chairman of the astronomy section of the american association for the advancement of science ( aaas ) . at the height of the cold war , sagan became involved in nuclear disarmament efforts by promoting hypotheses on the effects of nuclear war , when paul crutzen 's `` twilight at noon '' concept suggested that a substantial nuclear exchange could trigger a nuclear twilight and upset the delicate balance of life on earth by cooling the surface . in <year> he was one of five authors—the `` s '' —in the follow-up `` ttaps '' model ( as the research article came to be known ) , which contained the first use of the term `` nuclear winter '' , which his colleague richard p. turco had coined . in <year> he co-authored the book the cold and the dark : the world after nuclear war and in <year> the book a path where no man thought : nuclear winter and the end of the arms race , which explains the nuclear-winter hypothesis and advocates nuclear disarmament . sagan received a great deal of skepticism and disdain for the use of media to disseminate a very uncertain hypothesis . a personal correspondence with nuclear physicist edward teller around <year> began amicably , with teller expressing support for continued research to ascertain the credibility of the winter hypothesis . however , sagan and teller 's correspondence would ultimately result in teller writing : `` a propagandist is one who uses incomplete information to produce maximum persuasion . i can compliment you on being , indeed , an excellent propagandist , remembering that a propagandist is the better the less he appears to be one '' . biographers of sagan would also comment that from a scientific viewpoint , nuclear winter was a low point for sagan , although , politically speaking , it popularized his image amongst the public.the adult sagan remained a fan of science fiction , although disliking stories that were not realistic ( such as ignoring the inverse-square law ) or , he said , did not include `` thoughtful pursuit of alternative futures '' . he wrote books to popularize science , such as cosmos , which reflected and expanded upon some of the themes of a personal voyage and became the best-selling science book ever published in english ; the dragons of eden : speculations on the evolution of human intelligence , which won a pulitzer prize ; and broca 's brain : reflections on the romance of science . sagan also wrote the best-selling science fiction novel contact in <year> , based on a film treatment he wrote with his wife , ann druyan , in <year> , but he did not live to see the book 's <year> motion-picture adaptation , which starred jodie foster and won the <year> hugo award for best dramatic presentation . sagan wrote a sequel to cosmos , pale blue dot : a vision of the human future in space , which was selected as a notable book of <year> by the new york times . he appeared on pbs 's charlie rose program <days> january <year> . sagan also wrote the introduction for stephen hawking 's bestseller a brief history of time . sagan was also known for his popularization of science , his efforts to increase scientific understanding among the general public , and his positions in favor of scientific skepticism and against pseudoscience , such as his debunking of the betty and barney hill abduction . to mark the tenth anniversary of sagan 's death , david morrison , a former student of sagan , recalled `` sagan 's immense contributions to planetary research , the public understanding of science , and the skeptical movement '' in skeptical inquirer . following saddam hussein 's threats to light kuwait 's oil wells on fire in response to any physical challenge to iraqi control of the oil assets , sagan together with his `` ttaps '' colleagues and paul crutzen , warned <days> january <year> in the baltimore sun and wilmington morning star newspapers that if the fires were left to burn over a period of several months , enough smoke from the <integer> or so <year> kuwaiti oil fires `` might get so high as to disrupt agriculture in much of south asia ... '' and that this possibility should `` affect the war plans '' ; these claims were also the subject of a televised debate between sagan and physicist fred singer on january <days> , aired on the abc news program nightline . in the televised debate , sagan argued that the effects of the smoke would be similar to the effects of a nuclear winter , with singer arguing to the contrary . after the debate , the fires burnt for many months before extinguishing efforts were complete . the results of the smoke did not produce continental-sized cooling . sagan later conceded in the demon-haunted world that the prediction did not turn out to be correct : `` it was pitch black at noon and temperatures dropped 4–6 °c over the persian gulf , but not much smoke reached stratospheric altitudes and asia was spared '' .in his later years sagan advocated the creation of an organized search for asteroids/near-earth objects ( neos ) that might impact the earth but to forestall or postpone developing the technological methods that would be needed to defend against them . he argued that all of the numerous methods proposed to alter the orbit of an asteroid , including the employment of nuclear detonations , created a deflection dilemma : if the ability to deflect an asteroid away from the earth exists , then one would also have the ability to divert a non-threatening object towards earth , creating an immensely destructive weapon . in a <year> paper he co-authored , he ridiculed a <other> long `` near-earth object interception workshop '' held by los alamos national laboratory ( lanl ) in <year> that did not , `` even in passing '' state that such interception and deflection technologies could have these `` ancillary dangers '' .sagan remained hopeful that the natural neo impact threat and the intrinsically double-edged essence of the methods to prevent these threats would serve as a `` new and potent motivation to maturing international relations '' . later acknowledging that , with sufficient international oversight , in the future a `` work our way up '' approach to implementing nuclear explosive deflection methods could be fielded , and when sufficient knowledge was gained , to use them to aid in mining asteroids . his interest in the use of nuclear detonations in space grew out of his work in <year> for the armour research foundation 's project a119 , concerning the possibility of detonating a nuclear device on the lunar surface.sagan was a critic of plato , having said of the ancient greek philosopher : `` science and mathematics were to be removed from the hands of the merchants and the artisans . this tendency found its most effective advocate in a follower of pythagoras named plato '' and he ( plato ) believed that ideas were far more real than the natural world . he advised the astronomers not to waste their time observing the stars and planets . it was better , he believed , just to think about them . plato expressed hostility to observation and experiment . he taught contempt for the real world and disdain for the practical application of scientific knowledge . plato 's followers succeeded in extinguishing the light of science and experiment that had been kindled by democritus and the other ionians . in <year> ( as part of his book the demon-haunted world ) sagan popularized a set of tools for skeptical thinking called the `` baloney detection kit '' , a phrase first coined by arthur felberbaum , a friend of his wife ann druyan . === popularizing science === speaking about his activities in popularizing science , sagan said that there were at least two reasons for scientists to share the purposes of science and its contemporary state . simple self-interest was one : much of the funding for science came from the public , and the public therefore had the right to know how the money was being spent . if scientists increased public admiration for science , there was a good chance of having more public supporters . the other reason was the excitement of communicating one 's own excitement about science to others.following the success of cosmos , sagan set up his own publishing firm , cosmos store , in order to publish science books for the general public . it was not successful . === criticisms === while sagan was widely adored by the general public , his reputation in the scientific community was more polarized . critics sometimes characterized his work as fanciful , non-rigorous , and self-aggrandizing , and others complained in his later years that he neglected his role as a faculty member to foster his celebrity status.one of sagan 's harshest critics , harold urey , felt that sagan was getting too much publicity for a scientist and was treating some scientific theories too casually . urey and sagan were said to have different philosophies of science , according to davidson . while urey was an `` old-time empiricist '' who avoided theorizing about the unknown , sagan was by contrast willing to speculate openly about such matters . fred whipple wanted harvard to keep sagan there , but learned that because urey was a nobel laureate , his opinion was an important factor in harvard denying sagan tenure.sagan 's harvard friend lester grinspoon also stated : `` i know harvard well enough to know there are people there who certainly do not like people who are outspoken . '' grinspoon added : wherever you turned , there was one astronomer being quoted on everything , one astronomer whose face you were seeing on tv , and one astronomer whose books had the preferred display slot at the local bookstore . some , like urey , later came to realize that sagan 's popular brand of scientific advocacy was beneficial to the science as a whole . urey especially liked sagan 's <year> book the dragons of eden and wrote sagan with his opinion : `` i like it very much and am amazed that someone like you has such an intimate knowledge of the various features of the problem ... i congratulate you ... you are a man of many talents . `` sagan was accused of borrowing some ideas of others for his own benefit and countered these claims by explaining that the misappropriation was an unfortunate side effect of his role as a science communicator and explainer , and that he attempted to give proper credit whenever possible . === social concerns === sagan believed that the drake equation , on substitution of reasonable estimates , suggested that a large number of extraterrestrial civilizations would form , but that the lack of evidence of such civilizations highlighted by the fermi paradox suggests technological civilizations tend to self-destruct . this stimulated his interest in identifying and publicizing ways that humanity could destroy itself , with the hope of avoiding such a cataclysm and eventually becoming a spacefaring species . sagan 's deep concern regarding the potential destruction of human civilization in a nuclear holocaust was conveyed in a memorable cinematic sequence in the final episode of cosmos , called `` who speaks for earth ? '' sagan had already resigned from the air force scientific advisory board 's ufo investigating condon committee and voluntarily surrendered his top-secret clearance in protest over the vietnam war . following his marriage to his third wife ( novelist ann druyan ) <days> june <year> , sagan became more politically active—particularly in opposing escalation of the nuclear arms race under president ronald reagan . <days> march <year> , reagan announced the strategic defense initiative—a multibillion-dollar project to develop a comprehensive defense against attack by nuclear missiles , which was quickly dubbed the `` star wars '' program . sagan spoke out against the project , arguing that it was technically impossible to develop a system with the level of perfection required , and far more expensive to build such a system than it would be for an enemy to defeat it through decoys and other means—and that its construction would seriously destabilize the `` nuclear balance '' between the united states and the soviet union , making further progress toward nuclear disarmament impossible.when soviet leader mikhail gorbachev declared a unilateral moratorium on the testing of nuclear weapons , which would begin on august <days> , 1985—the 40th anniversary of the atomic bombing of hiroshima—the reagan administration dismissed the dramatic move as nothing more than propaganda and refused to follow suit . in response , us anti-nuclear and peace activists staged a series of protest actions at the nevada test site , beginning on easter sunday in <year> and continuing through <year> . hundreds of people in the `` nevada desert experience '' group were arrested , including sagan , who was arrested on two separate occasions as he climbed over a chain-link fence at the test site during the underground operation charioteer and united states 's musketeer nuclear test series of detonations.sagan was also a vocal advocate of the controversial notion of testosterone poisoning , arguing in <year> that human males could become gripped by an `` unusually severe [ case of ] testosterone poisoning '' and this could compel them to become genocidal . in his review of moondance magazine writer daniela gioseffi 's <year> book women on war , he argues that females are the only half of humanity `` untainted by testosterone poisoning '' . one chapter of his <year> book shadows of forgotten ancestors is dedicated to testosterone and its alleged poisonous effects.in <year> , carl sagan was interviewed by ted turner whether he believed in socialism and responded that : `` i 'm not sure what a socialist is . but i believe the government has a responsibility to care for the people ... i 'm talking about making the people self-reliant . '' == personal life and beliefs == sagan was married three times . in <year> , he married biologist lynn margulis . the couple had two children , jeremy and dorion sagan . after sagan and margulis divorced , he married artist linda salzman in <year> and they also had a child together , nick sagan . during these marriages , carl sagan focused heavily on his career , a factor which may have contributed to sagan 's first divorce . in <year> , sagan married author ann druyan and they later had two children , alexandra ( known as sasha ) and samuel sagan . carl sagan and druyan remained married until his death in <year> . while teaching at cornell , he lived in an egyptian revival house in ithaca perched on the edge of a cliff that had formerly been the headquarters of a cornell secret society . while there he drove a purple <year> porsche <integer> with the license plate phobos . he also owned an orange porsche <integer> . in <year> , engineers at apple computer code-named the power macintosh <year> `` carl sagan '' in the hope that apple would make `` billions and billions '' with the sale of the powermac <year> . the name was only used internally , but sagan was concerned that it would become a product endorsement and sent apple a cease-and-desist letter . apple complied , but engineers retaliated by changing the internal codename to `` bha '' for `` butt-head astronomer '' . sagan then sued apple for libel in federal court . the court granted apple 's motion to dismiss sagan 's claims and opined in dicta that a reader aware of the context would understand apple was `` clearly attempting to retaliate in a humorous and satirical way '' , and that `` it strains reason to conclude that defendant was attempting to criticize plaintiff 's reputation or competency as an astronomer . one does not seriously attack the expertise of a scientist using the undefined phrase 'butt-head ' . '' sagan then sued for apple 's original use of his name and likeness , but again lost . sagan appealed the ruling . <days> november <year> , an out-of-court settlement was reached and apple 's office of trademarks and patents released a conciliatory statement that `` apple has always had great respect for dr. sagan . it was never apple 's intention to cause dr. sagan or his family any embarrassment or concern . '' apple 's third and final code name for the project was `` law '' , short for `` lawyers are wimps '' .in <year> , carl sagan 's daughter sasha sagan released for small creatures such as we : rituals for finding meaning in our unlikely world , which depicts life with her parents and her father 's death when she was fourteen . building on a theme in her father 's work , sasha sagan argues in for small creatures such as we that skepticism does not imply pessimism . sagan was acquainted with the science fiction fandom through his friendship with isaac asimov , and he spoke at the nebula awards ceremony in <year> . asimov described sagan as one of only two people he ever met whose intellect surpassed his own . the other , he claimed , was the computer scientist and artificial intelligence expert marvin minsky . === naturalism === sagan wrote frequently about religion and the relationship between religion and science , expressing his skepticism about the conventional conceptualization of god as a sapient being . for example : some people think god is an outsized , light-skinned male with a long white beard , sitting on a throne somewhere up there in the sky , busily tallying the fall of every sparrow . others—for example baruch spinoza and albert einstein—considered god to be essentially the sum total of the physical laws which describe the universe . i do not know of any compelling evidence for anthropomorphic patriarchs controlling human destiny from some hidden celestial vantage point , but it would be madness to deny the existence of physical laws . in another description of his view on the concept of god , sagan wrote : the idea that god is an oversized white male with a flowing beard who sits in the sky and tallies the fall of every sparrow is ludicrous . but if by god one means the set of physical laws that govern the universe , then clearly there is such a god . this god is emotionally unsatisfying ... it does not make much sense to pray to the law of gravity . on atheism , sagan commented in <year> : an atheist is someone who is certain that god does not exist , someone who has compelling evidence against the existence of god . i know of no such compelling evidence . because god can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes , we would have to know a great deal more about the universe than we do now to be sure that no such god exists . to be certain of the existence of god and to be certain of the nonexistence of god seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed . sagan also commented on christianity and the jefferson bible , stating `` my long-time view about christianity is that it represents an amalgam of two seemingly immiscible parts , the religion of jesus and the religion of paul . thomas jefferson attempted to excise the pauline parts of the new testament . there was n't much left when he was done , but it was an inspiring document . '' regarding spirituality and its relationship with science , sagan stated : 'spirit ' comes from the latin word 'to breathe ' . what we breathe is air , which is certainly matter , however thin . despite usage to the contrary , there is no necessary implication in the word 'spiritual ' that we are talking of anything other than matter ( including the matter of which the brain is made ) , or anything outside the realm of science . on occasion , i will feel free to use the word . science is not only compatible with spirituality ; it is a profound source of spirituality . when we recognize our place in an immensity of light-years and in the passage of ages , when we grasp the intricacy , beauty , and subtlety of life , then that soaring feeling , that sense of elation and humility combined , is surely spiritual . an environmental appeal , `` preserving and cherishing the earth '' , signed by sagan with other noted scientists <days> january <year> , stated that `` the historical record makes clear that religious teaching , example , and leadership are powerfully able to influence personal conduct and commitment ... thus , there is a vital role for religion and science . '' in reply to a question in <year> about his religious beliefs , sagan answered , `` i 'm agnostic . '' sagan maintained that the idea of a creator god of the universe was difficult to prove or disprove and that the only conceivable scientific discovery that could challenge it would be an infinitely old universe . sagan 's views on religion have been interpreted as a form of pantheism comparable to einstein 's belief in spinoza 's god . his son , dorion sagan said , `` my father believed in the god of spinoza and einstein , god not behind nature but as nature , equivalent to it . '' his last wife , ann druyan , stated : when my husband died , because he was so famous and known for not being a believer , many people would come up to me—it still sometimes happens—and ask me if carl changed at the end and converted to a belief in an afterlife . they also frequently ask me if i think i will see him again . carl faced his death with unflagging courage and never sought refuge in illusions . the tragedy was that we knew we would never see each other again . i do n't ever expect to be reunited with carl . in <year> , ann druyan edited sagan 's <year> glasgow gifford lectures in natural theology into a book , the varieties of scientific experience : a personal view of the search for god , in which he elaborates on his views of divinity in the natural world . sagan is also widely regarded as a freethinker or skeptic ; one of his most famous quotations , in cosmos , was , `` extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence '' ( called the `` sagan standard '' by some ) . this was based on a nearly identical statement by fellow founder of the committee for the scientific investigation of claims of the paranormal , marcello truzzi , `` an extraordinary claim requires extraordinary proof . '' this idea had been earlier aphorized in théodore flournoy 's work from india to the planet mars ( <year> ) from a longer quote by pierre-simon laplace ( 1749–1827 ) , a french mathematician and astronomer , as the principle of laplace : `` the weight of the evidence should be proportioned to the strangeness of the facts . `` late in his life , sagan 's books elaborated on his naturalistic view of the world . in the demon-haunted world , he presented tools for testing arguments and detecting fallacious or fraudulent ones , essentially advocating wide use of critical thinking and the scientific method . the compilation billions and billions : thoughts on life and death at the brink of the millennium , published in <year> after sagan 's death , contains essays written by sagan , such as his views on abortion , as well as an account by his widow , ann druyan , of his death in relation to his having been an agnostic and freethinker . sagan warned against humans ' tendency towards anthropocentrism . he was the faculty adviser for the cornell students for the ethical treatment of animals . in the cosmos chapter `` blues for a red planet '' , sagan wrote , `` if there is life on mars , i believe we should do nothing with mars . mars then belongs to the martians , even if the martians are only microbes . '' === marijuana advocacy === sagan was a user and advocate of marijuana . under the pseudonym `` mr. x '' , he contributed an essay about smoking cannabis to the <year> book marihuana reconsidered . the essay explained that marijuana use had helped to inspire some of sagan 's works and enhance sensual and intellectual experiences . after sagan 's death , his friend lester grinspoon disclosed this information to sagan 's biographer , keay davidson . the publishing of the biography , carl sagan : a life , in <year> brought media attention to this aspect of sagan 's life . not long after his death , his widow ann druyan went on to preside over the board of directors of the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws ( norml ) , a non-profit organization dedicated to reforming cannabis laws . === ufos === in <year> , the year that inaugurated the `` flying saucer '' craze , the young sagan suspected the `` discs '' might be alien spaceships.sagan 's interest in ufo reports prompted him on august <days> , <year> , to write a letter to u.s. secretary of state dean acheson to ask how the united states would respond if flying saucers turned out to be extraterrestrial . : 51–52 he later had several conversations on the subject in <year> with jacques vallée . though quite skeptical of any extraordinary answer to the ufo question , sagan thought scientists should study the phenomenon , at least because there was widespread public interest in ufo reports . stuart appelle notes that sagan `` wrote frequently on what he perceived as the logical and empirical fallacies regarding ufos and the abduction experience . sagan rejected an extraterrestrial explanation for the phenomenon but felt there were both empirical and pedagogical benefits for examining ufo reports and that the subject was , therefore , a legitimate topic of study . `` in <year> sagan was a member of the ad hoc committee to review project blue book , the u.s. air force 's ufo investigation project . the committee concluded blue book had been lacking as a scientific study , and recommended a university-based project to give the ufo phenomenon closer scientific scrutiny . the result was the condon committee ( 1966–68 ) , led by physicist edward condon , and in their final report they formally concluded that ufos , regardless of what any of them actually were , did not behave in a manner consistent with a threat to national security . sociologist ron westrum writes that `` the high point of sagan 's treatment of the ufo question was the aaas ' symposium in <year> . a wide range of educated opinions on the subject were offered by participants , including not only proponents such as james mcdonald and j. allen hynek but also skeptics like astronomers william hartmann and donald menzel . the roster of speakers was balanced , and it is to sagan 's credit that this event was presented in spite of pressure from edward condon . '' with physicist thornton page , sagan edited the lectures and discussions given at the symposium ; these were published in <year> as ufo 's : a scientific debate . some of sagan 's many books examine ufos ( as did one episode of cosmos ) and he claimed a religious undercurrent to the phenomenon . sagan again revealed his views on interstellar travel in his <year> cosmos series . in one of his last written works , sagan argued that the chances of extraterrestrial spacecraft visiting earth are vanishingly small . however , sagan did think it plausible that cold war concerns contributed to governments misleading their citizens about ufos , and wrote that `` some ufo reports and analyses , and perhaps voluminous files , have been made inaccessible to the public which pays the bills ... it 's time for the files to be declassified and made generally available . '' he cautioned against jumping to conclusions about suppressed ufo data and stressed that there was no strong evidence that aliens were visiting the earth either in the past or present.sagan briefly served as an adviser on stanley kubrick 's film <year> : a space odyssey . : <integer> sagan proposed that the film suggest , rather than depict , extraterrestrial superintelligence . === `` sagan 's paradox '' === sagan 's contribution to the <year> aaas symposium was an attack on the belief that ufos are piloted by extraterrestrial beings . applying several logical assumptions ( see drake equation ) , sagan calculated the possible number of advanced civilizations capable of interstellar travel to be about one million . he projected that any civilization wishing to check on all the others on a regular basis of , say , once a year would have to launch 10,000 spacecraft annually . not only does that seem like an unreasonable number of launchings , but it would take all the material in one percent of the universe 's stars to produce all the spaceships needed for all the civilizations to seek each other out . to argue that the earth was being chosen for regular visitations , sagan said , one would have to assume that the planet is somehow unique , and that assumption `` goes exactly against the idea that there are lots of civilizations around . because if there are then our sort of civilization must be pretty common . and if we 're not pretty common then there are n't going to be many civilizations advanced enough to send visitors '' . this argument , which some called sagan 's paradox , helped to establish a new school of thought , namely the belief that extraterrestrial life exists , but it has nothing to do with ufos . the new belief had a salutary effect on ufo studies . it helped separate researchers who wanted to distinguish ufos from those who wanted to identify their pilots and it gave scientists opportunities to search the universe for intelligent life unencumbered by the stigma associated with ufos . === death === after suffering from myelodysplasia for two years and receiving three bone marrow transplants from his sister , sagan died from pneumonia at the age of <integer> at the fred hutchinson cancer research center in seattle , washington , on december <days> , <year> . his burial took place at lake view cemetery in ithaca , new york . == awards and honors == annual award for television excellence—1981—ohio state university—pbs series cosmos : a personal voyage apollo achievement award—national
