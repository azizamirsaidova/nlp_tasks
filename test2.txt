sir john richard nicholas stone ( <integer> august <year> – <integer> december <year> ) was an eminent british economist , educated at westminster school and cambridge university ( caius and king 's ) . in <year> he received the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences for developing an accounting model that could be used to track economic activities on a national and , later , an international scale . == early life == richard stone was born in london , uk on <integer> august <year> . he received an english upper middle class education when he was a child as he attended cliveden place and westminster school . however , he had not been taught mathematics and science until secondary school . when he was <integer> years old , he followed his father to india as his father was appointed as a judge in madras . from india , he visited many asian countries : malaya , singapore , and indonesia . after travelling for one year , he went back to london and studied at gonville and caius college , cambridge in <year> , where he studied law for two years . the young stone then changed to reading economics . he was interested in economics as he thought that `` if there were more economists , the world would be a better place '' . during the great slump of the 1930s , the of unemployment was very high and it motivated him to know what caused it and how to overcome it . he faced a challenge from his parents as they were disappointed to his choice . however , stone was very enthusiastic to be an economist and then enjoyed his time studying economics . at his new major , he got supervision from richard kahn and gerald shove . however , stone 's quantitative mind had been greatly influenced by colin clark , stone 's teacher in statistics at cambridge . clark then introduced stone to his project in measuring the national income . this project then brought the greatest name for stone as he received nobel prize because of this topic . after their meeting at cambridge , stone and clark then became best friends . == career == after graduating from cambridge in <year> and until world war ii he worked at lloyd 's of london . during the war , stone worked with james meade as a statistician and economist for the british government . at the government 's request they analyzed the uk 's economy related to the current total resources of the nation for the war time . it was at this time that they developed the early versions of the system of national accounts . their work resulted in the u.k. 's first national accounts in <year> . the collaboration between stone and meade was over after <year> as their office was split into two different ones . they then worked separately , meade being responsible for the economic section and stone , for the national income . in his new office , the central statistical office , stone became john maynard keynes ' assistant . stone left working for the government when the war ended in <year> . after the war , stone took up an academic career when he worked at cambridge as the director of the new department of applied economics ( 1945–1955 ) . as the director , stone made the department focus on research programmes about economic theory and statistical methodology . this strategy attracted many top economists in that era to join the department . some remarkable works at the department were , for example , durbin and watson on testing serial correlation in econometrics , and alan prest and derek rowe on demand analysis . this condition made dae become one of the leading quantitative economic research centres in the world in his era . stone himself had many projects in dae : national accounting where he had employed agatha chapman as a research associate , the analysis of consumer demand , and the system of socio-demographic account . in <year> , stone gave up his directorship at the department as he was appointed as the p.d . leake chair of finance and accounting at cambridge ( emeritus from <year> ) . together with j.a.c . brown he began the cambridge growth project , which developed the cambridge multisectoral dynamic model of the british economy ( mdm ) . in building the cambridge growth project , they used social accounting matrices ( sam ) , which also formed computable equilibrium model which then developed at the world bank . he was succeeded as leader of the cambridge growth project by terry barker . in <year> , stone was appointed as the chairman of the faculty board of economics and politics for the next two years . a company founded by members of the department and limited by guarantee , cambridge econometrics , was founded in <year> with stone as its first honorary president . the company continues to develop mdm and to use the model to make economic forecasts . before retiring from cambridge in <year> , stone served as the president of the royal economic society for 1978–1980 . == achievements == stone in <year> received the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences for developing an accounting model that could be used to track economic activities on a national and , later , an international scale . while he was not the first economist to work in this field , he was the first to do so with double entry accounting . double entry accounting basically states that every income item on one side of the balance sheet must be met by an expenditure item on the opposite side of the accounting sheet therefore creating a system of balance . this double entry system is the basis of nearly all modern accounting today . this allowed for a reliable way of tracking trade and wealth transfer on a global scale . he is sometimes known as the 'father of national income accounting ' , and is the author of studies of consumer demand statistics and demand modeling , economic growth , and input-output.during his acceptance speech stone mentioned françois quesnay as well as the tableau économique . stone stated that it was one of the first works in economics to examine various sectors on such a global level and how they are all interconnected . == personal life == stone married three times . in <year> , he married winifred mary jenkins who was also from cambridge . both of them had a passion for economics and started a monthly paper called trends , which was a supplement to the periodical , industry illustrated . it contained articles about the british economic conditions . soon after , in <year> , he was asked to join the ministry of economic warfare . the couple 's marriage dissolved in <year> . soon after , in <year> stone married his second wife feodora leontinoff . feodora died in <year> . in <year> , he married giovanna saffi , great-grandchild of italian patriot aurelio saffi , who became his partner in many of his works . they collaborated for some projects in economics , for example in rewriting his book `` national income and expenditure '' in <year> . == death == stone

votes . he never again faced such a close contest , and was reelected <integer> times . lantos earned a reputation as a champion for various human rights causes , such as having yahoo ceo jerry yang testify at a congressional hearing , when the company turned over the email records of two chinese dissidents to the chinese government , allowing them to be traced and one sentenced to jail.lantos was a member of the congressional progressive caucus , and repeatedly called for reforms to the nation 's health-care system , reduction of the national budget deficit and the national debt , repeal of the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of <year> . he opposed social security privatization efforts . he supported same-sex marriage rights and marijuana for medical use , was a strong proponent of gun control and adamantly pro-choice.lantos was an advocate on behalf of the environment , receiving consistently high ratings from the league of conservation voters and other environmental organizations for his legislative record . his long-standing efforts to protect open space brought thousands of acres under the protection of the golden gate national recreation area , including mori point , sweeney ridge , and rancho corral de tierra , which will keep its watersheds and delicate habitats free from development permanently . while lantos initially supported the iraq war , from <year> onward he distanced himself , making increasingly critical statements about the conduct of the war . == foreign affairs issues == lantos served as the chairman of the united states house committee on foreign affairs . through its more than <integer> years of work , the congressional human rights caucus—of which lantos was co-chair with representative frank wolf—covered a wide range of human rights issues . they included speaking for christians in saudi arabia and sudan to practice their faith , helping tibetans to retain their culture and religion in tibet , and advocating for other minorities worldwide . among his other efforts was a demand that japan apologize for sex slavery during world war ii . he declared turkey 's mass killings of armenians during world war i to be genocide . in more recent times , he supported democracy in burma and pressed for sanctions on iran for supporting terrorism . in <year> , he sponsored a bill to stop the spread of anti-semitism.on other aspects of american foreign policy , lantos spoke out against waste , fraud and abuse in the multi-billion dollar u.s. reconstruction program in iraq , and warned that the u.s. could lose afghanistan to the taliban if the bush administration failed to take decisive action to halt the current decline in political stability there . lantos was against u.s. military aid to egypt as the egyptian military had failed to stop the flow of money and weapons across the egyptian border to hamas in gaza , and egypt had not contributed troops to the peacekeeping efforts in afghanistan and elsewhere . === <year> gulf war === lantos was a strong supporter of the <year> persian gulf war . during the run-up to the war , the congressional human rights caucus , of which lantos was co-chairman , hosted a young kuwaiti woman identified only as `` nurse nayirah '' , who told of horrific abuses by iraqi soldiers , including the killing of kuwaiti babies by taking them out of their incubators and leaving them to die on the cold floor of the hospital . these alleged atrocities figured prominently in the rhetoric at the time about iraqi abuses in kuwait . the girl 's account was later challenged by independent human rights monitors . `` nurse nayirah '' later turned out to be the daughter of the kuwaiti ambassador to the united states . asked about having allowed the girl to give testimony without identifying herself , and without her story having been corroborated , lantos replied , `` the notion that any of the witnesses brought to the caucus through the kuwaiti embassy would not be credible did not cross my mind ... i have no basis for assuming that her story is not true , but the point goes beyond that . if one hypothesizes that the woman 's story is fictitious from a to z , that in no way diminishes the avalanche of human rights violations . `` the canadian broadcasting corporation sent investigators to kuwait who went through the hospital and counted the incubators and they found that `` except for one or two that may have been misplaced '' all of the incubators were still in the hospital . the investigators concluded that there were no deaths resulting from stolen equipment . and the doctor who provided amnesty international with the number of babies killed dropped from <integer> to <integer> and then <integer> , <integer> of which died before the invasion of kuwait by iraq . after the war , the new york times wrote , `` it 's plainly wrong for a member of congress to collaborate with a public relations firm to produce knowingly deceptive testimony on an important issue . yet representative tom lantos has been caught doing exactly that . his behavior warrants a searching inquiry by the house ethics committee . '' === war in iraq === on october <days> , <year> , lantos led a narrow majority of democrats on the house international relations committee to a successful vote in support of the resolution for the use of force , seeking the approval of the united nations and under the condition that president george w. bush would allow un weapons inspectors to finish their work and that bush would need to return to congress for an actual declaration of war before invading iraq . the resolution later passed the house and the senate with a total of <integer> members of congress supporting it . `` the train is now on its way '' , said lantos after the resolution successfully passed both houses of congress . in later hearings on the war , lantos continued his enthusiastic support . starting in early <year> , lantos distanced himself from the bush administration 's iraq policy , making critical statements at hearings , on the house floor and in published media interviews about the conduct of the war . during hearings of the house international relations committee , where he was then the ranking member , lantos repeatedly praised the investigative work of the office of the special inspector of iraq reconstruction general stuart bowen , which uncovered evidence of waste , fraud and abuse in the use of u.s. taxpayer dollars intended to help secure and rebuild iraq . lantos was an immediate and consistent critic of the troop surge advocated by president bush . on the night <days> january <year> that bush announced his plan , lantos responded , `` i oppose the so-called surge that constitutes the centerpiece of the president 's plan . our efforts in iraq are a mess , and throwing in more troops will not improve it . `` during a joint house hearing on september <days> , <year> , featuring general david petraeus and ambassador ryan crocker , lantos said : the administration 's myopic policies in iraq have created a fiasco . is it any wonder that on the subject of iraq , more and more americans have little confidence in this administration ? we can not take any of this administration 's assertions on iraq at face value anymore , and no amount of charts or statistics will improve its credibility . this is not a knock on you , general petraeus , or on you , ambassador crocker . but the fact remains , gentlemen , that the administration has sent you here today to convince the members of these two committees and the congress that victory is at hand . with all due respect to you , i must say ... i do n't buy it . at the same hearing , lantos drew comparisons between some of the current u.s. activities in iraq to u.s. support two decades ago of islamic militants in afghanistan : america should not be in the business of arming , training and funding both sides of a religious civil war in iraq . did the administration learn nothing from our country 's actions in afghanistan two decades ago , when by supporting islamist militants against the soviet union , we helped pave the way for the rise of the taliban ? why are we now repeating the short-sighted patterns of the past ? == human rights advocate == === tibet === as co-founder of the congressional human rights caucus in <year> and as chairman of the foreign affairs committee , lantos would `` stir the consciousness of world leaders and the public alike '' , according to representative nancy pelosi . she added : `` wherever there was injustice or oppression , he used his expertise and moral authority to put the united states on the side of justice and human rights '' . in <year> , in his effort to help the people of china and tibet , he presented the dalai lama with the congressional gold medal . === darfur === on april <days> , <year> , lantos and four other democratic u.s . representatives , along with six other activists , took part in a civil disobedience action in front of the sudanese embassy in washington , d.c . they were protesting the role of the sudanese government in carrying out genocide in the darfur conflict and were arrested for disorderly conduct . === hungarian minorities === lantos was an activist for the rights of hungarian minorities ; as a member of the us house of representatives . in a <year> letter he asked robert fico , the prime minister of slovakia to distance themselves from the beneš decrees , a reasonable process in the hedvig malina case , and to treat members of the hungarian minority as equal.the american hungarian federation recognized congressman lantos for his `` leadership in support of democracy , human rights and minority rights in central and eastern europe '' , awarding him the organization 's highest award , the `` col. commandant michael kovats medal of freedom '' , at the october <days> , <year> , congressional reception commemorating the 49th anniversary of the <year> hungarian revolution . === lebanon === on august <days> , <year> , at the israeli foreign ministry building in israel , lantos said he would block a foreign aid package promised by president george w. bush to lebanon unless and until beirut agreed to the deployment of international troops on the border with syria and lebanon takes control of its borders with syria to prevent arms smuggling to hezbollah guerrillas . === morocco and western sahara === lantos supported morocco 's demand to gain sovereignty over western sahara , and criticized the polisario front , which demands independence for the disputed region . in <year> , he backed morocco 's proposal to make the region autonomous under moroccan rule , saying : `` i urge the leadership of the polisario to realize that they will never again get such a good deal for the population they purport to represent . '' == death and legacy == on january <days> , <year> , after having been diagnosed with esophageal cancer , lantos announced he would not run for a 15th term in the house , but planned to complete his final term , and thanked congress : it is only in the united states that a penniless survivor of the holocaust and a fighter in the anti-nazi underground could have received an education , raised a family , and had the privilege of serving the last three decades of his life as a member of congress . i will never be able to express fully my profoundly felt gratitude to this great country . '' lantos died of complications from esophageal cancer on february <days> , <year> , before finishing his term . a special election was held to fill his seat on april <days> , <year> , and was won by former state senator jackie speier , whom lantos had endorsed . shortly after his death , roy blunt , the house republican whip , stated that `` chairman lantos will be remembered as a man of uncommon integrity and sincere moral conviction — and a public servant who never wavered in his pursuit of a better , freer and more religiously tolerant world . `` a memorial service was held for lantos on february <days> , <year> , at statuary hall in the capitol . speakers included senator joe biden , bono of u2 , rep. steny hoyer , un secretary general ban ki-moon , israeli foreign minister tzipi livni , speaker nancy pelosi , secretary of state condoleezza rice , rep. christopher shays and elie wiesel.he was buried in congressional cemetery in washington , d.c .. on june <days> , <year> , president george w. bush posthumously awarded lantos the medal of freedom . in a ceremony at the white house , bush stated `` we miss his vigorous defense of human rights and his powerful witness for the cause of human freedom . for a lifetime of leadership , for his commitment to liberty , and for his devoted service to his adopted nation , i am proud to award the presidential medal of freedom , posthumously , to tom lantos , and proud that his loving wife annette will receive the award on behalf of his family . `` in <year> , the congressional human rights caucus , which he founded in <year> , was renamed the tom lantos human rights commission . its mission is partly `` to promote , defend and advocate internationally recognized human rights .

'' with the full backing of the soviets , tsedenbal successfully purged his political opponents . during his reign as head of the state , tsedenbal submitted requests for the incorporation of mongolia into the ussr on five to eight occasions , but these proposals were invariably rejected by the soviet leaders . with the intensification of the sino-soviet border conflict in the 60s , the signing of `` the treaty of friendship , cooperation and mutual assistance between the ussr and the mongolian people 's republic '' in ulaanbaatar in early <year> by brezhnev and tsedenbal , allowed the soviet union to station troops in mongolia to ensure mutual defense , being the first time that foreign troops would be stationed in the republic . ==== relations with china ==== in the early years of his rule , he favored balanced relations between mongolia and china . in <year> , tsedenbal was in beijing for the 10th anniversary of the people 's republic of china.at the time of the sino-soviet split , tsedenbal decisively sided with the soviet union and incurred china 's wrath . despite this , the two countries managed to sign a border treaty in <year> . in the early 60s , he signed an order expelling all chinese citizens from mongolia . the resolution was met with outrage : `` break off tsedenbal 's dog 's head , '' was written onto the mongolian embassy , and mao zedong and zhou enlai stated that `` comrade tsedenbal is trampling on diplomacy . '' ==== other communist nations ==== <days> july <year> , he welcomed north korean leader kim il-sung on a state visit . as it relates to the korean conflict , tsedenbal , during a <year> visit of the north korean deputy premier in honor of the 50th anniversary of the mongolian people ’ s revolution , declared that his nation `` strongly support the struggle of the korean people to unify the motherland by peaceful , democratic means and for the liberation of south korea .

berzon , r.i.p . associated press obituary printed in sf gate lambda literary memoriam l.a. times obituary thomas dörflein ( <integer> october <year> – <integer> september <year> ) was a german zookeeper at the berlin zoological garden for <integer> years . after the baby polar bear knut was abandoned by his mother shortly after his birth in <year> , dörflein—who cared for both the zoo 's wolves and the bears—was assigned as the cub 's caretaker . as a result of the zoo 's decision to raise knut by hand , and the resultant close relationship between keeper and animal , dörflein became a reluctant celebrity . == early life and career == dörflein was born in berlin 's wedding neighborhood , but was raised in the city 's spandau district . he trained for three years to become a zookeeper , after which he took a job at the berlin zoo . at first he was responsible for the zoo 's apes , predators and cliff-dwelling animals , but in <year> he was put in charge of the bears and wolves . == knut == on <integer> december <year> , knut was found at a research island and was rushed to berlin zoo for treatment . the cubs ' mother rejected them for unknown reasons , abandoning them on a rock in the polar bear enclosure . zookeepers rescued the cubs by scooping them out of the enclosure with an extended fishing net , but knut 's brother died of an infection four days later . only the size of a guinea pig , knut spent the first <integer> days of his life in an incubator before dörflein began raising the cub . knut 's need for around-the-clock care required that dörflein sleep on a mattress next to knut 's sleeping crate at night , and play with , bathe , and feed the cub daily . knut 's diet began with a bottle of baby formula mixed with cod liver oil every two hours , before graduating at the age of four months to a milk porridge mixed with cat food and vitamins . dörflein also accompanied knut on his twice-daily one-hour shows for the public and therefore appeared in many videos and photographs alongside the cub . as a result , dörflein became a minor celebrity in germany . he received fan mail , and even marriage proposals , all of which made him uncomfortable ; when asked about his sudden rise to fame , the zookeeper said , `` it 's very strange to me . `` <days> october <year> , dörflein was awarded berlin 's medal of merit in honor of his continuous care for the cub . several months beforehand , knut 's and dörflein 's daily shows had been halted when it was decided that knut had grown too large for the zookeeper to safely accompany him in the enclosure . with knut nearing his first birthday , his zookeeper was barred from physical contact with the bear . == death == dörflein died suddenly in berlin at the age of <integer> of a heart attack on <integer> september <year> . dörflein had been seriously ill for some time , and had recently taken some time from work after having been diagnosed with bladder cancer ; according to reports , he had gone into remission . he was survived by a stepdaughter , a son , and his girlfriend and her young son.berlin newspaper b.z . wrote of dörflein , `` everyone wanted to be like [ him ] ... he not only cared for knut ; he nurtured our desire to see harmony between man and beast . '' the berlin zoo , where dörflein was employed for <integer> years , released an official statement describing the death as tragic and a `` great loss '' . the group friends of the berlin zoo stated : `` with the passing of thomas dörflein , the zoo has lost a highly dedicated zookeeper who had great passion for his job and his calling . '' the statement went on to note how dörflein played a decisive role in turning berlin `` into a sensational attraction with the polar bear cub . '' zoo biologist heiner klös added : `` i am shocked by the passing of my best zookeeper , a man who gave his all for his animals . `` <days> january <year> , dörflein was the recipient of b.z . 's posthumous honorary award for bringing joy to berlin through his relationship with knut . the zoo established a prize for outstanding zookeepers in dörflein 's honour . the first thomas dörflein prize , which carries a €1,000 cash prize as well as a trophy , was awarded <days> june <year> . knut succeeded him in death on <integer> march <year> after collapsing in his enclosure , at the age of four . on december <days> , <year> , a memorial dedicated to knut was unveiled near dörflein 's grave in spandau , on what would have been the bear 's fifth birthday . == references == == external links == berlin zoo official website hugh gardner ackley ( june <days> , <year> – february <days> , <year> ) was an american economist and diplomat . ackley served as a member of the council of economic advisers under president john f. kennedy , and as the chairman under president lyndon b. johnson from <year> to <year> . he also served as ambassador to italy from <year> to <year> . ackley was a member of the university of michigan faculty for <integer> years and served as chair of its economics department . upon returning to the university following his ambassadorship , he was named the henry carter adams professor of political economy . in <year> he served as president of the american economic association.ackley was born in indianapolis , indiana in <year> , and was raised in kalamazoo , michigan where he attended public schools and graduated from western michigan university in <year> . he earned a ph.d from the university of michigan in <year> , and joined the faculty that year . he served in the u.s. office of price administration and the office of strategic services in washington , d.c. , from <year> to <year> and as assistant director of the u.s. office of price stabilization from <year> to 1952.ackley believed that government had a definite role in fine tuning the economy , using both fiscal and monetary intervention . he warned president johnson in <year> that a tax increase was needed to finance the escalation of the war in vietnam and the increased social welfare spending that johnson was undertaking . johnson did not ask for a tax increase , and economists , including paul samuelson , believed this was the cause of the inflation of the 1970s.ackley was the author of the popular graduate-level textbook macroeconomic theory , which was translated into several languages and remained the standard advanced text during the 1960s and early 1970s . he was awarded a fellowship from the american academy of arts and sciences in <year> and another fellowship from the ford foundation . == selected publications == `` relative prices and aggregate consumer demand '' , with d.b . suits , <year> , american economic review . `` the wealth-saving relationship '' , journal of political economy , <year> . `` administered prices and the inflationary process '' , american economic review , <year> . macroeconomic theory , macmillan company , <year> ; republished as macroeconomics : theory and policy , <year> . stemming world inflation , the atlantic institute , <year> . `` an incomes policy for the 1970s '' , review of economics and statistics , <year> . macroeconomics : theory and policy , macmillan library reference <year> . `` the costs of inflation '' , american economic review , <year> . == references == richard abel musgrave ( december <days> , <year> – january <days> , <year> ) was an american economist of german heritage . his most cited work is the theory of public finance ( <year> ) , described as `` the first english-language treatise in the field , '' and `` a major contribution to public finance thought . '' == biography == === early life === musgrave was born in königstein im taunus , germany , into the family of a writer and translator curt abel musgrave , a chemist by profession . his paternal grandfather ( professor of linguistics at the berlin humboldt institute carl abel ) and maternal grandmother were jewish but converted to christianity . he turned from the field of literature , with an interest in becoming a stage director , to philosophy and economics at the universities of munich and heidelberg ( diplom-volkswirt , <year> ) , then at harvard ( ph.d. , <year> ) . after that , he spent four years as a research economist at the federal reserve and taught at several american universities , including the university of michigan where he worked on his treatise from <year> to <year> . he served as an advisor to the us government and returned to harvard in <year> as h. h. burbank professor of political economy in the faculty of arts and sciences and the law school . he was also editor of the quarterly journal of economics . his book the theory of public finance ( <year> ) remains a leading theoretical work . public finance in theory and practice ( <year> ) , co-authored with his wife , peggy brewer musgrave , was a leading textbook for many years . === career in economics === martin feldstein is quoted in the new york times obituary ( jan <integer> , <year> ) `` richard musgrave transformed economics in the 1950s and 1960s from a descriptive and institutional subject to one that used the tools of microeconomics and keynesian macroeconomics to understand the effect of taxes . '' musgrave published his seminal paper , `` voluntary exchange theory of public economy '' in the quarterly journal of economics in <year> . paul samuelson would later convert this from a positive theory to a normative theory . it is from the <year> paper `` voluntary exchange theory of public economy '' that 'the musgrave three-function framework ' originates . this framework is the suggestion that government activity should be separated into three functions or `` branches , '' macroeconomic stabilization , income redistribution and resource allocation . the stabilization branch is to assure the achievement of high employment and price stability , the distribution branch is to achieve an equitable distribution of income , and the allocation branch is to see that resources are used efficiently . this conceptual division of the responsibilities of government allows us to narrow the scope of inquiry into tax assignment , by indicating which of the three functions are most appropriately assigned to various levels of government . the remainder of this section focuses on the implications of the three-branch framework for the assignment of revenue sources among levels of government , especially the assignment between the central government and second-tier governments . in his paper , `` a multiple theory of budget determination , '' published in finanzarchiv <year> , musgrave introduced the economic concept of merit good ( and later , de-merit good ) . the concept has been extensively discussed elsewhere and been quite controversial in economic theory . his background in the german , austrian , italian and swedish schools of political economy plus the uniquely german contribution of finanzwissenschaft , or fiscal sociology , gave him a unique position to make a contribution to postwar government finance theory . == accolades == musgrave was elected a fellow in american academy of arts and sciences , honorary member of the national tax association , and honorary president of the institute of public finance ( <year> ) . awarded the frank e seidman award in political economy ( <year> ) , honorary doctorates from alleghany college , university of heidelberg , university of milan , university of michigan , and the university of munich , he was a professor emeritus at harvard until his death , and an adjunct professor at the university of california at santa cruz . musgrave was designated a distinguished fellow by the american economic association in <year> , along with william s. vickrey . an accompanying statement referred to him as `` the undisputed father of modern industrial organization economics . `` the international institute of public finance created an award in <year> to commemorate the work conducted by richard and his wife . == personal == he died on january <days> , <year> in santa cruz , california . == selected works == buchanan , james m. & musgrave , richard a .

welfare economics ; capital ; finance , particularly the efficient-market hypothesis ; public finance , particularly optimal allocation ; international economics , particularly the balassa–samuelson effect and the heckscher–ohlin model ; macroeconomics , particularly the overlapping generations model ; and market economics . == biography == samuelson was born in gary , indiana , on may <days> , <year> , to frank samuelson , a pharmacist , and ella née lipton . his family , he later said , was `` made up of upwardly mobile jewish immigrants from poland who had prospered considerably in world war i , because gary was a brand new steel-town when my family went there '' . in <year> , samuelson moved to chicago where he graduated from hyde park high school ( now hyde park career academy ) . he then studied at the university of chicago and received his bachelor of arts degree there in <year> . he said he was born as an economist , at 8.00am on january <days> , <year> , in the university of chicago classroom . the lecture mentioned as the cause was on the british economist thomas malthus , who most famously studied population growth and its effects . samuelson felt there was a dissonance between neoclassical economics and the way the system seemed to behave ; he said henry simons and frank knight were a big influence on him . he next completed his master of arts degree in <year> , and his doctor of philosophy in <year> at harvard university . he won the david a . wells prize in <year> for writing the best doctoral dissertation at harvard university in economics , for a thesis titled `` foundations of analytical economics '' , which later turned into foundations of economic analysis . as a graduate student at harvard , samuelson studied economics under joseph schumpeter , wassily leontief , gottfried haberler , and the `` american keynes '' alvin hansen . samuelson moved to mit as an assistant professor in <year> and remained there until his death.samuelson 's family included many well-known economists , including brother robert summers , sister-in-law anita summers , brother-in-law kenneth arrow and nephew larry summers . during his seven decades as an economist , samuelson 's professional positions included : assistant professor of economics at mit , <year> ; associate professor , <year> . member of the radiation laboratory 1944–45 . professor of international economic relations ( part-time ) at the fletcher school of law and diplomacy in <year> . guggenheim fellowship from <year> to <year> professor of economics at mit beginning in <year> and institute professor beginning in <year> . vernon f. taylor visiting distinguished professor at trinity university ( texas ) in spring <year> . === death === samuelson died after a brief illness on december <days> , <year> , at the age of <integer> . his death was announced by the massachusetts institute of technology . james m. poterba , an economics professor at mit and the president of the national bureau of economic research , commented that samuelson `` leaves an immense legacy , as a researcher and a teacher , as one of the giants on whose shoulders every contemporary economist stands '' . susan hockfield , the president of mit , said that samuelson `` transformed everything he touched : the theoretical foundations of his field , the way economics was taught around the world , the ethos and stature of his department , the investment practices of mit , and the lives of his colleagues and students '' . == fields of interest == as professor of economics at the massachusetts institute of technology , samuelson worked in many fields , including : consumer theory , where he pioneered the revealed preference approach , which is a method by which one can discern a consumer 's utility function , by observing their behavior . rather than postulate a utility function or a preference ordering , samuelson imposed conditions directly on the choices made by individuals – their preferences as revealed by their choices . welfare economics , in which he popularised the lindahl–bowen–samuelson conditions ( criteria for deciding whether an action will improve welfare ) and demonstrated in <year> the insufficiency of a national-income index to reveal which of two social options was uniformly outside the other 's ( feasible ) possibility function ( collected scientific papers , v. <integer> , ch . <integer> ; fischer , <year> , p. <integer> ) . capital theory , where he is known for <year> consumption loans model and a variety of turnpike theorems and involved in cambridge capital controversy . finance theory , in which he is known for the efficient-market hypothesis . public finance theory , in which he is particularly known for his work on determining the optimal allocation of resources in the presence of both public goods and private goods . international economics , where he influenced the development of two important international trade models : the balassa–samuelson effect , and the heckscher–ohlin model ( with the stolper–samuelson theorem ) . macroeconomics , where he popularized the overlapping generations model as a way to analyze economic agents ' behavior across multiple periods of time ( collected scientific papers , v. <integer> , ch . <integer> ) and contributed to formation of the neoclassical synthesis . market economics : samuelson believed unregulated markets have drawbacks , he stated , `` free markets do not stabilise themselves . zero regulating is vastly suboptimal to rational regulating . libertarianism is its own worst enemy ! '' samuelson strongly criticised friedman and friedrich von hayek arguing their opposition to state intervention `` tells us something about them rather than something about genghis khan or franklin roosevelt . it is paranoid to warn against inevitable slippery slopes ... once individual commercial freedoms are in any way infringed upon . '' == impact == samuelson is considered one of the founders of neo-keynesian economics and a seminal figure in the development of neoclassical economics . in awarding him the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences the committee stated : more than any other contemporary economist , samuelson has helped to raise the general analytical and methodological level in economic science . he has simply rewritten considerable parts of economic theory . he has also shown the fundamental unity of both the problems and analytical techniques in economics , partly by a systematic application of the methodology of maximization for a broad set of problems . this means that samuelson 's contributions range over a large number of different fields . he was also essential in creating the neoclassical synthesis , which ostensibly incorporated keynesian and neoclassical principles and still dominates current mainstream economics . in <year> , samuelson was one of the ten nobel prize–winning economists signing the economists ' statement opposing the bush tax cuts . == aphorisms and quotations == stanislaw ulam once challenged samuelson to name one theory in all of the social sciences that is both true and nontrivial . several years later , samuelson responded with david ricardo 's theory of comparative advantage : `` that it is logically true need not be argued before a mathematician ; that is not trivial is attested by the thousands of important and intelligent men who have never been able to grasp the doctrine for themselves or to believe it after it was explained to them . `` for many years , samuelson wrote a column for newsweek . one article included samuelson 's most quoted remark and a favorite economics joke : to prove that wall street is an early omen of movements still to come in gnp , commentators quote economic studies alleging that market downturns predicted four out of the last five recessions . that is an understatement . wall street indexes predicted nine out of the last five recessions ! and its mistakes were beauties . in the early editions of his famous , bestselling economics textbook paul samuelson joked that gdp falls when a man `` marries his maid '' . == publications == === foundations of economic analysis === paul samuelson 's book foundations of economic analysis ( <year> ) is considered his magnum opus . it is derived from his doctoral dissertation , and was inspired by the classical thermodynamic methods . the book proposes to : examine underlying analogies between central features in theoretical and applied economics and study how operationally meaningful theorems can be derived with a small number of analogous methods ( p. <integer> ) , in order to derive `` a general theory of economic theories '' ( samuelson , <year> , p. xxvi ) . the book showed how these goals could be parsimoniously and fruitfully achieved , using the language of the mathematics applied to diverse subfields of economics . the book proposes two general hypotheses as sufficient for its purposes : maximizing behavior of agents ( including consumers as to utility and business firms as to profit ) and economic systems ( including a market and an economy ) in stable equilibrium.in the first tenet , his views presented the idea that all actors , whether firms or consumers , are striving to maximize something . they could be attempting to maximize profits , utility , or wealth , but it did not matter because their efforts to improve their well-being would provide a basic model for all actors in an economic system . his second tenet was focused on providing insight on the workings of equilibrium in an economy . generally in a market , supply would equal demand . however , he urged that this might not be the case and that the important thing to look at was a system 's natural resting point . foundations presents the question of how an equilibrium would react when it is moved from its optimal point . samuelson was also influential in providing explanations on how the changes in certain factors can affect an economic system . for example , he could explain the economic effect of changes in taxes or new technologies . in the course of analysis , comparative statics , ( the analysis of changes in equilibrium of the system that result from a parameter change of the system ) is formalized and clearly stated . the chapter on welfare economics `` attempt ( s ) to give a brief but fairly complete survey of the whole field of welfare economics '' ( samuelson , <year> , p. <integer> ) . it also exposits on and develops what became commonly called the bergson–samuelson social welfare function . it shows how to represent ( in the maximization calculus ) all real-valued economic measures of any belief system that is required to rank consistently different feasible social configurations in an ethical sense as `` better than '' , `` worse than '' , or `` indifferent to '' each other ( p. <integer> ) . === economics === samuelson is also author ( and since <year> co-author ) of an influential principles textbook , economics , first published in <year> ( 19th ed . as of <year> ; multiple reprints ) . the book sold more than 300,000 copies of each edition from <year> through <year> and was translated in the forty-one languages . as of <year> , it has sold over four million copies . william nordhaus joined as co-author on the 12th edition ( <year> ) . sometime before <year> , it had become the best-selling economics textbook of all time.samuelson was once quoted as saying , `` let those who will write the nation 's laws if i can write its textbooks . '' written in the shadow of the great depression and the second world war , it helped to popularize the insights of john maynard keynes . a main focus was how to avoid , or at least mitigate , the recurring slumps in economic activity . samuelson wrote : `` it is not too much to say that the widespread creation of dictatorships and the resulting world war ii stemmed in no small measure from the world 's failure to meet this basic economic problem [ the great depression ] adequately . '' this reflected the concern of keynes himself with the economic causes of war and the importance of economic policy in promoting peace.samuelson 's book was the second to introduce keynesian economics to a wide audience , and was by far the most successful . canadian economist lorie tarshis , who had been a student attending keynes 's lectures at harvard in the 1930s , published in <year> an introductory textbook that incorporated his lecture notes , titled elements of economics . === other publications === there are <integer> papers in samuelson 's collected scientific papers . stanley fischer ( <year> , p. <integer> ) writes that taken together they are `` unique in their verve , breadth of economic and general knowledge , mastery of setting , and generosity of allusions to predecessors '' . samuelson was co-editor , along with william a. barnett , of inside the economist 's mind : conversations with eminent economists ( blackwell publishing , <year> ) , a collection of interviews with notable economists of the 20th century . == criticisms == === textbook influences in higher education === samuelson 's textbook was a watershed in introducing a serious study of business cycles in the economics curriculum . it was particularly timely because it followed the great depression , which had only ended because of the fiscal stimulus of world war ii . the study of business cycles along with the introduction of the keynesian approach of aggregate demand set the stage for the macroeconomic revolution in america , which then diffused throughout the world through translations into every major language . generations of students , who then became teachers , learned their first and most influential lessons from samuelson 's economics . it attracted many imitators , who became successful in different niches of the college market . the text was not without criticism . while it praised the `` mixed economy '' of market and government , some found that too radical and attacked it as socialist . as a precursor to criticisms of samuelson 's economics textbook , lorie tarshis 's textbook was attacked by trustees of , and donors to , american colleges and universities as preaching a `` socialist heresy '' . piling on , william f. buckley , jr. , in his <year> book , god and man at yale , devoted an entire chapter , attacking both samuelson 's and tarshis ' textbooks . for samuelson 's book , buckley drew from the educational examiner and credited it as an `` excellent review of samuelson 's text . '' ( `` note to chapter two . '' p. <integer> ) for tarshis ' book , buckley drew from merwin k. hart 's organization to wit : `` i am also grateful to the national economic council for its telling analysis of the tarshis . '' ( `` note to chapter two . '' p. <integer> ) buckley essentially characterized both as – in the words of paul davidson – `` communist inspired '' . buckley , for the rest of his life , defended the criticisms set forth in his book . === economic growth of ussr === one criticism – of a concept that samuelson added to his economics textbook – was the comparison of usa growth rates with those of the ussr , which , according to the criticism , was inconsistent with historical gnp differences . the textbook 's <year> edition ( 7th ed . ) extrapolates ( projects ) the possibility of ussr/us real gnp parity between <year> and <year> . each subsequent edition extrapolates a date range further in the future until those graphs were dropped from the <year> edition ( 12th ed. ) . === phillips curve === samuelson , together with robert solow , helped develop and popularize the mathematics of the phillips curve . the curve suggested that unemployment and inflation were inversely related ; with the advent of stagflation in the 1970s some economists including milton friedman and friedrich hayek attacked the economics based on the phillips curve as questionable or mistaken . == memberships == member of the american academy of arts and sciences , national academy of sciences , fellow of royal society of london fellow of the american philosophical society and the british academy ; president ( 1965–68 ) of the international economic association member and past president ( <year> ) of the american economic association member of the editorial board and past-president ( <year> ) of the econometric society fellow , council member and past vice-president of the royal economic society . member of phi beta kappa . == list of publications == samuelson , paul a .

university of pennsylvania , mostly known for his contributions to general equilibrium theory . his most famous work was on the ramsey–cass–koopmans model of economic growth . == biography == david cass was born in <year> in honolulu , hawaii . he earned an a.b . in economics from the university of oregon in <year> and started to study law at the harvard law school as he thought of becoming a lawyer according to family tradition . as he hated studying law he left the program after one year and served in the army from <year> to <year> . he then entered the economics ph.d. program at stanford university . here he met karl shell , although the two began to work together only after both graduated . cass 's doctoral advisor was hirofumi uzawa , who also introduced him to tjalling koopmans , who at that time was a professor at yale university . in <year> , cass graduated with a ph.d. in economics and statistics with a dissertation on optimal growth , with parts of the dissertation later published in the review of economic studies.after graduation cass began to work from <year> to <year> as an assistant professor at the economics department of yale university and as a research associate at the cowles commission for research in economics in new haven . during his time at yale university he collaborated with menahem yaari and joseph stiglitz and worked mostly on overlapping generations models . in <year> he left new haven for carnegie-mellon university in pittsburgh , where he was a professor of economics until <year> . during his time at carnegie-mellon he began to collaborate with karl shell , who at this time was a professor at the university of pennsylvania . one of his doctoral students was finn e. kydland , who would later win the nobel prize in economics . in <year> cass left for the university of pennsylvania , where he was a professor of economics until his death . david cass died in <year> in philadelphia after a long illness . he was divorced and the father of two children.cass was a guggenheim fellow in <year> , was an elected fellow of the econometric society since <year> , received an honorary doctorate from the university of geneva in <year> , was a distinguished fellow of the american economic association in <year> and was an elected fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences since <year> . == research == cass made important contributions to pure economic theory , mostly in the field of general equilibrium theory . he made major contributions to the theory of optimal growth , the theory of sunspots and the theory of incomplete markets . he is perhaps best known for his article “ optimum growth in an aggregative model of capital accumulation ” , which was a part of his dissertation . in this paper he proves a necessary and sufficient condition for efficiency in the neoclassical growth model first introduced by frank ramsey . a major difference to the standard ramsey growth model was that cass considered the case where consumption in future periods is discounted , thus implicitly assuming that consumers prefer consumption today to consumption tomorrow . this modified version of the ramsey growth model is also known as the ramsey-cass-koopmans model , named after frank ramsey , david cass and tjalling koopmans.he was also famous for the `` cass criterion '' for overlapping generations models and in the neoclassical growth model , and his work , together with karl shell , on the influence of extrinsic uncertainty on economic equilibria , also known as the concept of sunspot equilibria or the theory of sunspots . together with joseph stiglitz he proved conditions under which it is possible for an investor to achieve an optimal portfolio under the restriction of being able to buy only two mutual funds . they also showed that generally the demand for money can not be derived from portfolio theory . cass was also a major contributor to the theory of incomplete markets , the turnpike theory and theory of economies with markets that repeatedly open over time . === cass 's scientific works === dave cass 's first major contribution to economics was the characterization of optimal growth trajectories in his thesis work under hirofumi uzawa ’ s supervision at stanford university . the celebrated cass criterion for optimal time paths in the one good growth model quickly followed . the essence of this work is the search for price characterizations of efficiency for dynamic time paths , an effort that directly pointed the way to the subsequent full dynamic decentralization of the neoclassical optimal growth model , a fact that permits its use for modeling a wide range of business cycle and other macroeconomic phenomena . accordingly , cass is rightly honored , together with tjalling koopmans and frank ramsey , as one of the fathers of dynamic macroeconomic analysis . the original papers from cass 's thesis were • '' optimum economic growth in an aggregative model of capital accumulation , '' published in the review of economic studies in <year> • '' optimum economic growth in the two-sector model of capital accumulation '' • '' optimum economic growth in an aggregative model of capital accumulation : a turnpike theorem , '' published in econometrica in 1966the `` optimum growth ... '' paper was the culmination of a long line of research ( beginning with frank ramsey 's pioneering research in the 1920s ) on modeling economic growth . the literature found expression in the post-war period in the work of robert solow at mit and hirofumi uzawa at stanford , not only as a theory of growth , but also as a tool for understanding the macroeconomy . much of the development of the models in the literature was grounded in a set of post-war `` stylized facts '' that every economics ph.d. student learns in their first year of graduate study . one of the weak links in the development of these early models was their specification of saving behavior as being exogenous and given by the empirical regularity of the consumption-income relationship , and the various ( partial equilibrium ) theories of consumption spending designed to explain this regularity . cass 's paper was the first to endogenize the consumption-savings decision by deriving an optimal capital accumulation trajectory that maximized the discounted sum of utility payoffs over time . the tools that cass used to derive his results were from the then-newly developed field of optimal control in mathematics pioneered by lev pontryagin . the main results in the paper are a demonstration that under now-standard assumptions on preferences and technology , the optimal accumulation sequence exists and is unique . the other papers in cass 's thesis drew on the major insights of the `` optimum growth ... '' paper by extending them to show the existence of an optimal growth trajectory in a two-sector model of capital accumulation , and the existence of a so-called turnpike growth path associated with the optimal capital accumulation trajectory in the one-sector model . these papers were published ( possibly even completed ) while cass was a research staff member and then an assistant professor at the cowles foundation at yale university ( 1964–1967 ) . cass was promoted to untenured associate professor at cowles and remained at yale until <year> . he coauthored several more papers during this time with joseph stiglitz and menahem yaari , who were also at yale during this period . these included : • '' a re-examination of the pure consumption loans model '' ( with m.e . yaari ) . j pol econ <integer> , 353–367 ( <year> ) . • '' individual saving , aggregate capital accumulation and efficient growth '' ( with m.e . yaari ) . essays in the theory of optimal economic growth ( k. shell , ed . ) , mit , <year> . • '' the implications of alternative saving and expectations hypotheses for the choice of techniques and patterns of growth '' ( with j.e . stiglitz ) . j pol econ <integer> , 586–627 ( <year> ) . • '' the structure of investor preferences and asset returns , and separability in portfolio allocation '' ( with j.e . stiglitz ) . j econ theory <integer> , 122–160 ( <year> ) . • '' present values playing the role of efficiency prices in the one-good growth model '' ( with m.e . yaari ) . rev econ studies <integer> , 331–339 ( <year> ) .in the spear and wright macroeconomic dynamics interview with cass , he indicates that his work with manny yaari at yale constituted his introduction to samuelson 's consumption loans ( now overlapping generations ) model , which would come front and center as a major workhorse model in cass 's subsequent work with karl shell on sunspot equilibria . during this time , cass also looked more deeply at the question of how individual saving behavior and efficient growth were related . the paper on present values as efficiency prices that cass co-authored with yaari is easily seen to be a precursor of his subsequent work at carnegie mellon on capital overaccumulation and efficiency which led to the famous cass criterion for determining inefficiency . finally , cass 's work with stiglitz on modeling investor preferences and asset returns provided a foundation for his later work on financial general equilibrium . cass left yale in <year> , describing himself as part of yale 's `` junior through-put . '' he was recruited by dick cyert , then dean of the graduate school of industrial administration at carnegie mellon university . during his time at gsia , cass completed the work on capital overaccumulation , continued his work with joe stiglitz on asset pricing , and began work exploring the general applicability of the mathematical techniques he had used in his thesis ( mathematical programming , duality and the hamiltonian approach to dynamic control ) . the papers produced during this period included : • '' on capital overaccumulation in the aggregative , neoclassical model of economic growth : a complete characterization , '' j econ theory <integer> , 200–203 ( <year> ) . • '' distinguishing inefficient competitive growth paths : a note on capital overaccumulation and rapidly diminishing future value of consumption in a fairly general model of capitalistic production . '' j econ theory <integer> , 224–240 ( <year> ) . • '' risk aversion and wealth effects on portfolios with many assets '' ( with j.e . stiglitz ) . rev econ studies <integer> , 331–354 ( <year> ) . • '' on the wicksellian point-input , point-output model of capital accumulation : a modern view ( or neoclassicism slightly vindicated ) . '' j pol econ <integer> , 71–97 ( <year> ) . • '' duality : a symmetric approach from the economist 's vantage point . '' j econ theory <integer> , 272–295 ( <year> ) . • '' the hamiltonian representation of static competitive or efficient allocation . '' essays in modern capital theory , ( m. brown , k. sato , and p. zaremba , eds . ) , north-holland , <year> . • '' the structure and stability of competitive dynamical systems '' ( with k. shell ) . j econ theory <integer> , 31–70 ( <year> ) .while the last two papers were published after cass left gsia , he indicates in the interview that he began this work while he was still at carnegie mellon . cass ’ s second seminal contribution—the notion of a so-called sunspot equilibrium in dynamic economies which he developed jointly with karl shell—is also the stuff of legend , and grew out of his long and productive collaboration with karl at penn . the early impetus for cass ’ s interest in this topic stemmed from work he did with manny yaari on overlapping generations models , and from his early acquaintance with bob lucas at carnegie mellon and lucas ’ s seminal work on rational expectations in dynamic economic models . to quote from the spear-wright interview , i wasn ’ t so interested in macro , but what struck me , and this is related to some of my later work , was the assumption that [ lucas ] made to solve for equilibrium , that the state variables were obvious ... bob and i had some long discussions , and i would say , “ well bob , why is this the actual state space in this model ? ” that question came up ... after i came to penn . at some point karl [ shell ] and i started talking about that and we developed what we called the idea of sunspots.the key paper that came out of cass 's and karl 's discussions was the `` do sunspots matter ? '' paper published in the journal of political economy in <year> . much of the work leading up to this paper focused on the overlapping generations model : • '' the role of money in supporting the pareto optimality of competitive equilibrium in consumption-loan type models '' ( with m. okuno and i. zilcha ) . j econ theory <integer> , 41–80 ( <year> ) . • '' in defense of a basic approach '' ( with k. shell ) . models of monetary economies ( j.h . kareken and n. wallace , eds . ) , federal reserve bank of minneapolis , <year> . • '' existence of competitive equilibrium in a general overlapping-generations model '' ( with y. balasko and k. shell ) . j econ theory <integer> , 307–322 ( <year> ) .the first actual model of sunspot equilibrium was produced by shell in an olg framework with linear utility functions , which appeared in his `` monnai et allocation intertemporelle '' in <year> , as part of the malinvaud lecture series in paris ( now published as a vintage paper in macroeconomic dynamics ) . cass and shell 's jpe paper presented a simplified , two-period dynamic model in which one of two sets of agents could trade assets contingent on prices in the second period , while the second set of agents could only trade on the second period spot markets . this captured the friction of restricted participation present in olg economies , where some agents ( the newly entering young ) are born into a specific state and can not insure themselves against outcomes in the birth state . the paper demonstrated that in static arrow-debreu economies with complete markets , extrinsic uncertainty ( where no fundamentals of the model are stochastic ) can not matter to equilibrium allocations . they then showed that when some agents were restricted in their trades , so that market completeness was violated , sunspots could matter , i.e . there could exist rational expectations equilibria in which equilibrium prices depended on the realization of an extrinsic stochastic process . in passing , they made the observation that since the validity of the first welfare theorem implied that there could be no sunspot equilibria , a necessary condition for the existence of such equilibria was a violation of the conditions under which the first welfare theorem holds . this observation took on a life of its own as what shell called the philadelphia pholk theorem : if the first welfare theorem does n't hold , then you can find an economy where sunspots matter . in addition to raising troubling questions about what the right state space was for dynamic stochastic economies , the notion of sunspot equilibrium raised a number of deep questions about the overall determinacy of economic equilibria and the role of the welfare theorems in the occurrence or non-occurrence of sunspot equilibria . these questions spawned a large literature on determinacy in dynamic economies in which the welfare theorems broke down . these include overlapping generations models , growth models with externalities or taxes , and models in which asset markets were incomplete . all were shown to allow the existence of sunspot equilibria . and , in a suitable twist of intellectual fate , macroeconomists have recently begun to explore the question of whether sunspot expectations can provide a more plausible source of fluctuations in dynamic equilibrium models than the conventional aggregate productivity disturbances . cass ’ s third major contribution to economic theory was his work on general equilibrium with incomplete markets , work which grew out of his exploration of the question of existence of sunspot equilibria in models with incomplete asset markets . cass ’ s follow-on work on existence and determinacy of general equilibrium in models with incomplete asset markets spawned another large literature which has come to be known simply as gei . as an historical note , cass never really liked this terminology , preferring instead to think of these models as ones of general financial equilibrium ( gfe ) to emphasize the presence of financial assets and the frictions these introduced . the earliest work on market incompleteness goes back to arrow in the 1950s , diamond in the mid- ‘ <integer> ’ s and a number of related papers in the finance literature between the late 1950s and early ‘ <integer> ’ s ( geanakoplos provides an excellent survey of this literature ) . the canonical gei model was formulated by radner in the early 1970s in a paper which also pointed up one of the fundamental puzzles about models with incomplete markets : the possible loss of dimensionality in the span of the asset payoffs as prices vary . this potential for non-existence of equilibrium ( which was formally developed in hart ’ s counterexamples to existence of equilibrium ) left the literature in limbo for almost a decade , until cass ’ s work on existence in economies with purely financial assets pointed the way out . as geanakoplos notes suddenly in the middle 1980s the pure theory of gei fell into place . in two provocative and influential papers , cass showed that the existence of equilibrium could be guaranteed if all the assets promise delivery in fiat money , and he gave an example showing that with such financial assets there could be a multiplicity of equilibrium . almost simultaneously werner also gave a proof of existence of equilibrium with financial assets , and geanakoplos and polemarchakis showed the same for economies with real assets that promise delivery in the same consumption good.the first paper that geanakoplos references above appeared initially <days> april <year> as a caress working paper . this work was followed very quickly by results showing that the non-existence problem pointed out by hart was not generic , and led ultimately to the generic existence results of duffie and shafer , and again spawned a new literature looking positively at the welfare implication of market incompleteness , and normatively at issues of asset engineering . in the time after this seminal work in gei , cass 's various papers dealt with issues of determinacy of equilibrium ( and the closely related issue of existence of sunspot equilibria ) , and with the optimality of allocations in the presence of sunspots and incomplete asset markets . these papers include : • '' the structure of financial equilibrium with exogenous yields : the case of incomplete markets '' ( with y. balasko ) . econometrica <integer> , 135–162 ( <year> ) . • '' sunspot equilibrium in an overlapping-generations economy with an idealized contingent claims market '' ( with k. shell ) . economic complexity : chaos , sunspots , bubbles , and nonlinearity ( w.a . barnett , j. geweke , and

for this reason , he was subsequently certified by the american board of psychiatry and neurology as a diplomate in both specialties . == professional career == in <year> , oldendorf joined the faculty of the new medical school at the university of california , los angeles and the staff of the nearby ucla-affiliated west los angeles veterans administration medical center . he became an active member of the academic community , where his scientific , clinical , and teaching abilities were admired at the bedside , in seminars , at clinical conferences , in the auditorium , and in his laboratory . he engaged students and colleagues in long discussions about neurologic theory , the scientific process , or results of medical research . by <year> , oldendorf was an attending neurologist at the wadsworth va-ucla medical center where his ability to apply techniques from one field to another did not go unnoticed . he was universally characterized as `` likable '' , `` friendly '' , `` amusing '' , `` creative '' , `` intense '' , and `` humble '' . oldendorf 's interest neuroimaging was precipitated by a dislike for invasive procedures ( like pneumoencephalography and direct carotid puncture ) that he performed as a clinical neurologist . oldendorf found that these traumatic , tedious tests provided only limited and indirect information about the brain . at ucla , he started his seminal investigations into the two major lines of research that would define his career : x-ray shadow radiography and cerebral angiography . the first line was influential in the evolving concept of neuroimaging ; the second yielded fundamental knowledge of brain metabolism and mechanisms of the blood–brain barrier . == contributions to medical science == === role in development of neuroimaging === in <year> , oldendorf conceived an idea for `` scanning a head through a transmitted beam of x-rays , and being able to reconstruct the radiodensity patterns of a plane through the head '' by watching an engineer who was working on an automated apparatus to reject frostbitten fruit by detecting dehydrated portions . not until <year> did he complete a working prototype of his idea , apply ( for $ <year> ) for a patent on his idea , and publish an article detailing the work . ingeniously , by using materials found in his home ( such as his son 's toy train , a phonograph turntable , and an alarm clock motor ) , oldendorf demonstrated a method of producing cross-sectional images of soft tissue by back-projection and reconstruction . in his landmark paper , also published in <year> , he described the basic concept later used by allan mcleod cormack to develop the mathematics behind computerized tomography , though prof. cormack was unaware of oldendorf 's work . in october <days> <year> oldendorf finally received a u.s. patent for a `` radiant energy apparatus for investigating selected areas of interior objects obscured by dense material , '' . this work was recognized by godfrey hounsfield as the only other attempt at tomographic reconstruction , and , indeed , formed the basis of much of his nobel prize-winning work . the prototype developed by dr. oldendorf , however , did not lead to the development of the first industrial cat scanning device . when suggested to a leading x-ray manufacturer of the time , the president of the company retorted , even if it could be made to work as you suggest , we can not imagine a significant market for such an expensive apparatus which would do nothing but make a radiographic cross-section of a head . faced with this reaction , oldendorf `` turned his attention to other scientific work and heard nothing further about the idea until <year> . '' however , his idea was a fundamental discovery which also led to mri , positron emission tomography ( pet ) , single photon emission computed tomography ( spect ) , and other imaging techniques . once these techniques became widely accepted , dr. oldendorf , along with william markley mckinney , md ( 1930–2003 ) were instrumental in promoting the use of computed tomography among neurologists to help decrease the use of superfluous and invasive tests . === blood–brain barrier === oldendorf made many other discoveries that have significantly affected neuroscience and the practice of medicine . he developed an original method to analyze blood flow in the brain and the kinetics of blood-brain permeability . the idea of the blood–brain barrier was already entrenched in medical science by this time , but had never been quantified . oldendorf 's work in measuring blood flow with radioactive isotopes was fundamental to the subsequent development of techniques now used in many nuclear medicine laboratories . his methods of assessing blood–brain barrier permeability increased knowledge of the mechanisms whereby drugs and metabolic substrates enter into the brain . especially important was his characterization of more than a dozen independent carrier systems , along with their saturation kinetics . today , most of what is known of the selective permeability of the blood–brain barrier was either established by oldendorf in his laboratory , or by others using his ingenious techniques . these results have been essential in developing pet and spect imaging ; in studying glucose transport and brain metabolism ; and in characterizing clinically important diseases such as cerebral ischemia , starvation , and epilepsy . oldendorf 's experiments were also was the first to prove that cerebrospinal fluid functions as a `` sink '' in relationship to brain metabolism , a concept that is being investigated in relation to the pathophysiology of presenile dementias such as alzheimer 's disease . === professional publications and societies === in his lifetime , oldendorf wrote three textbooks and over <integer> scientific articles , including the quest for an image of the brain : computerized tomography in the perspective of past and future imaging methods ( raven press , new york , <year> ) and basics of magnetic resonance imaging ( kluwer academic press , boston , <year> ) . the book basics of magnetic resonance imaging is notable for being co-authored with his son and namesake , william oldendorf , jr. oldendorf was one of the <integer> attendees of the neurology computed tomography symposium , organized by william kinkel from september <days> to september <days> , <year> , in buffalo , new york . he participated in the ad hoc committee that unanimously voted to form the society for computerized tomography so as to continue its educational activities . realizing that other imaging modalities may eventually be prominent , the following year oldendorf pushed to have the name of the society changed to society for computerized tomography and neuroimaging , and served as its president from <year> to <year> . this society was to rename itself the american society for neuroimaging ( asn ) in <year> , also with the prodding of oldendorf . oldendorf was on several editorial boards and was a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences . in <year> , he became the first neurologist ever to be elected to the national academy of sciences . == awards and prizes == in <year> , he shared the ziedses des plantes gold medal ( given by the german society of neuroradiology and the medical physics society of wurzburgin ) with godfrey hounsfield . oldendorf was also awarded the albert and mary lasker award for clinical research in <year> along with prof. hounsfield for `` concepts and experiments which directly anticipated and demonstrated the feasibility of computerized tomography , which has revolutionized the field of neurological diagnosis '' . he received a special leadership award from the american academy of neurology in <year> for `` contributions to clinical neurology , including computerized tomographic scanning , studies on the blood–brain barrier , and research on cerebral metabolism . '' in <year> he received the president 's award for distinguished federal civilian service and the medical sciences award from the ucla alumni association . oldendorf was also fellow of the institute of electrical and electronics engineers ( <year> ) , distinguished founder of the american board of nuclear medicine science , honorary doctorate of science ( <year> ) from albany medical college and union college , honorary doctorate of science ( <year> ) from st. louis university , and keynote speaker at the annual meeting of the japanese society of neuroradiology in tokyo in february <days> <year> === nobel prize controversy === despite all his contributions to medical science , and despite the awards won in conjunction with the other eventual winners , oldendorf was not awarded the nobel prize in physiology or medicine with his colleagues godfrey hounsfield and allan cormack in <year> . this was in concordance with the nobel committee 's tradition of denying the prize to researchers in applied research ( who have m.d . degrees ) in favor of researchers in the basic sciences ( who have ph.d. degrees ) . rosalyn yalow , a nobel laureate herself , nominated oldendorf for the prize and was reportedly upset that he did not get it . in the january <year> issue of the journal science ( vol . <integer> , page <integer> ) , william j . broad wrote an article titled `` the riddle of the nobel debate '' in which he posited that politics in stockholm forced the removal of dr. oldendorf 's name during the nomination process . it was theorized that giving the prize to another american could sway pending patent litigation in europe over the rights to the ct scanner . == death and legacy == despite the controversy over the nobel prize , oldendorf was remarkably aplomb about the issue . he was supposed to have remarked naturally i 'm disappointed ; but i 'll keep working and maybe one day i 'll win a nobel prize for something else -- if i live long enough . he died unexpectedly on december <days> , <year> from the complications of heart disease . in his eulogy , l. jolyon west ( chairman of psychiatry at ucla ) stated , bill 's mind was einstein 's universe , finite , but boundless . always reaching into spheres you would n't imagine . he was survived by his wife , stella oldendorf , three sons , and the implications of his work which are still being investigated . in his honor , the oldendorf award is given annually by the american society of neuroimaging based on the submission of a manuscript that involves clinical research in computerized tomography , magnetic resonance imaging , spect or pet scanning . == references == biography of dr. oldendorf role of dr. oldendorf in formation of the asn article from american journal of neuroradiology regarding the controversy over the nobel prize article on blood–brain barrier co-authored by dr. oldendorf another article on nuclear medicine co-authored by dr. oldendorf leonid vitaliyevich kantorovich ( russian : леони́д вита́льевич канторо́вич , ipa : [ lʲɪɐˈnʲit vʲɪˈtalʲjɪvʲɪtɕ kəntɐˈrovʲɪtɕ ] ( listen ) ;

'' == mathematics == in mathematical analysis , kantorovich had important results in functional analysis , approximation theory , and operator theory . in particular , kantorovich formulated some fundamental results in the theory of normed vector lattices , especially in dedekind complete vector lattices which is named called `` k-spaces '' and are now referred to as `` kantorovich spaces '' in his honor . kantorovich showed that functional analysis could be used in the analysis of iterative methods , obtaining the kantorovich inequalities on the convergence rate of the gradient method and of newton 's method ( see the kantorovich theorem ) . kantorovich considered infinite-dimensional optimization problems , such as the kantorovich-monge problem in transport theory . his analysis proposed the kantorovich -- rubinstein metric , which is used in probability theory , in the theory of the weak convergence of probability measures . == see also == list of russian mathematicians list of economists shadow price == references == makarov , v.

. == work == throughout the years ackoff 's work in research , consulting and education has involved more than <integer> corporations and <integer> governmental agencies in the u.s. and abroad . === operations research === russell ackoff started his career in operations research at the end of the 1940s . his <year> book introduction to operations research , co-authored with c. west churchman and leonard arnoff , was one of the first publications that helped define the field . the influence of this work , according to kirby and rosenhead ( <year> ) , `` on the early development of the discipline in the usa and in britain in the 1950s and 1960s is hard to over-estimate '' .in the 1970s ackoff became one of the most important critics of the so-called `` technique-dominated operations research '' , and starting proposing more participative approaches . his critiques , according to kirby and rosenhead ( <year> ) , `` had little resonance within the usa , but were picked up both in britain , where they helped to stimulate the growth of problem structuring methods , and in the systems community world-wide '' , such as soft systems methodology from peter checkland . === purposeful systems === in <year> ackoff wrote a book with frederick edmund emery about purposeful systems , which focused on the question how systems thinking relates to human behaviour . `` individual systems are purposive '' , they said , `` knowledge and understanding of their aims can only be gained by taking into account the mechanisms of social , cultural , and psychological systems '' .any human-created systems can be characterized as `` purposeful system '' when its `` members are also purposeful individuals who intentionally and collectively formulate objectives and are parts of larger purposeful systems '' . other characteristics are : `` a purposeful system or individual is ideal-seeking if ... it chooses another objective that more closely approximates its ideal '' . `` an ideal-seeking system or individual is necessarily one that is purposeful , but not all purposeful entities seek ideals '' , and `` the capability of seeking ideals may well be a characteristic that distinguishes man from anything he can make , including computers '' .according to kirby and rosenhead ( <year> ) , `` the fact that these systems were experiencing profound change could be attributed to the end of the `` machine age '' and the onset of the `` systems age '' . the machine age , bequeathed by the industrial revolution , was underpinned by two concepts – reductionism ( everything can in the end be decomposed into indivisible parts ) and mechanism ( cause-effect relationships ) '' . hereby `` all phenomena were believed to be explained by using only one ultimately simple relationship , cause-effect '' , which in the systems age are replaced by expansionism and teleology with producer-product replacing cause-effect . `` expansionism is a doctrine maintaining that all objects and events , and all experiences of them , are parts of larger wholes . '' according to ackoff , `` the beginning of the end of the machine age and the beginning of the systems age could be dated to the 1940s , a decade when philosophers , mathematicians , and biologists , building on developments in the interwar period , defined a new intellectual framework '' . === f-laws === in <year> , ackoff worked with herbert j. addison and sally bibb . they developed the term f-law to describe a series of over <integer> distilled observations of bad leadership and the misplaced wisdom that often surrounds management in organizations . a collection of subversive epigrams published in two volumes by triarchy press , these f-laws expose the common flaws in both the practice of leadership and in the established beliefs that surround it . according to ackoff `` f-laws are truths about organizations that we might wish to deny or ignore – simple and more reliable guides to managers ' everyday behavior than the complex truths proposed by scientists , economists , sociologists , politicians and philosophers '' . === white house communications agency === in collaboration with dr. j. gerald suarez , ackoff 's ideas were introduced and implemented at the white house communications agency and the white house military office during the clinton and bush administrations , a historic effort to bring the white house into the age of systems thinking . === relationship to peter drucker === russell ackoff was friends with peter drucker from the earliest days of their careers . mr. drucker acknowledged the early , critical contribution ackoff made to his work – and the world of management in general – in the following letter , which was delivered to ackoff by former general motors v.p . vince barabba on the occasion of the 3rd international conference on systems thinking in management ( icstm ) held at the university of pennsylvania <days> may 19–24 , <year> : i was then , as you may recall , one of the early ones who applied operations research and the new methods of quantitative analysis to specific business problems—rather than , as they had been originally developed for , to military or scientific problems . i had led teams applying the new methodology in two of the world ’ s largest companies—ge and at & t . we had successfully solved several major production and technical problems for these companies—and my clients were highly satisfied . but i was not—we had solved technical problems but our work had no impact on the organizations and on their mindsets . on the contrary : we had all but convinced the managements of these two big companies that quantitative manipulation was a substitute for thinking . and then your work and your example showed us—or at least , it showed me—that the quantitative analysis comes after the thinking—it validates the thinking ; it shows up intellectual sloppiness and uncritical reliance on precedent , on untested assumptions and on the seemingly “ obvious. ” but it does not substitute for hard , rigorous , intellectually challenging thinking . it demands it , though—but does not replace it . this is , of course , what you mean by system . and your work in those far-away days thus saved me—as it saved countless others—from either descending into mindless “ model building ” – the disease that all but destroyed so many of the business schools in the last decades—or from sloppiness parading as ‘ insight. ’ == publications == ackoff authored or co-authored <integer> books and published over <integer> articles in a variety of journals . books : <year> , psychologistics , with c. west churchman . <year> , measurement of consumer interest , with c. w. churchman and m. wax ( ed. ) . <year> , methods of inquiry : an introduction to philosophy and scientific method , with c. w. churchman . educational publishers : st. louis . <year> , the design of social research . <year> , introduction to operations research , with c. w. churchman and e. l. arnoff . john wiley & sons : new york . <year> , progress in operations research , i. wiley : new york . <year> , scientific method : optimizing applied research decisions , wiley : new york . <year> , a manager 's guide to operations research , with p. rivett . wiley : new york . <year> , fundamentals of operations research , with m. sasieni . john wiley & sons : new york . <year> , a concept of corporate planning . wiley-interscience : new york . <year> , on purposeful systems : an interdisciplinary analysis of individual and social behavior as a system of purposeful events , with frederick edmund emery , aldine-atherton : chicago . <year> , redesigning the future : a systems approach to societal problems . john wiley & sons : new york . <year> , systems and management annual , ( ed. ) . <year> , the scatt report , with t. a. cowan , peter davis ( ed. ) . <year> , some observations and reflections on mexican development . <year> , the art of problem solving : accompanied by ackoff 's fables . john wiley & sons : new york . illustrations by karen b. ackoff . <year> , creating the corporate future : plan or be planned for . john wiley & sons : new york . <year> , a guide to controlling your corporation 's future , with e.v . finnel and jamshid gharajedaghi . <year> , revitalizing western economies , with p. broholm and r. snow . <year> , management in small doses . john wiley & sons : new york . <year> , ackoff 's fables : irreverent reflections on business and bureaucracy . john wiley & sons : new york . <year> , the democratic corporation : a radical prescription for recreating corporate america and rediscovering success . oxford univ . press : new york . <year> , exploring personality : an intellectual odyssey . cqm : cambridge , ma . <year> , ackoff 's best : his classic writings on management . john wiley & sons : new york . <year> , re-creating the corporation : a design of organizations for the 21st century . oxford univ . press : new york . <year> , `` a theory of a system for educators and managers '' , with w. edwards deming <year> , redesigning society , with sheldon rovin . stanford univ . press : stanford , calif. <year> , beating the system , with sheldon rovin . triarchy press , devon , uk <year> , idealized design : how to dissolve tomorrow 's crisis today , with jason magidson and herbert j. addison . wharton school publishing . upper saddle river , nj . <year> , a little book of f-laws , with herbert j. addison and sally bibb . triarchy press , devon , uk <year> , management f-laws , with herbert j. addison and sally bibb . triarchy press , devon , uk <year> , turning learning right side up : putting education back on track ( pdf ) with daniel greenberg . <year> , memories . triarchy press , devon , uk <year> , differences that make a difference . triarchy press , devon , uk <year> , ackoff 's f/laws : the cake . triarchy press , devon , uk === articles , a selection === <year> . `` management misinformation systems '' . in : management science , <integer> ( <integer> ) , <year> , 147–156 . <year> , `` general systems theory and systems research contrasting conceptions of systems science .

'' == references == hedy lamarr ( ; born hedwig eva maria kiesler ; november <days> , <year> – january <days> , <year> ) was an austrian-born american film actress and inventor.after a brief early film career in czechoslovakia , including the controversial ecstasy ( <year> ) , she fled from her husband , a wealthy austrian ammunition manufacturer , and secretly moved to paris . traveling to london , she met metro-goldwyn-mayer studio head louis b. mayer , who offered her a movie contract in hollywood . she became a film star with her performance in algiers ( <year> ) . her mgm films include lady of the tropics ( <year> ) , boom town ( <year> ) , h.m. pulham , esq . ( <year> ) , and white cargo ( <year> ) . her greatest success was as delilah in cecil b. demille 's samson and delilah ( <year> ) . she also acted on television before the release of her final film , the female animal ( <year> ) . she was honored with a star on the hollywood walk of fame in 1960.at the beginning of world war ii , she and composer george antheil developed a radio guidance system for allied torpedoes that used spread spectrum and frequency hopping technology to defeat the threat of jamming by the axis powers . although the us navy did not adopt the technology until the 1960s , the principles of their work are incorporated into bluetooth and gps technology and are similar to methods used in legacy versions of cdma and wi-fi . this work led to their induction into the national inventors hall of fame in <year> . == early life == lamarr was born hedwig eva maria kiesler in <year> in vienna , austria-hungary , the only child of gertrud `` trude '' kiesler ( née lichtwitz ; 1894–1977 ) and emil kiesler ( 1880–1935 ) . her father was born to a galician jewish family in lemberg ( now lviv in ukraine ) and was a bank director at the creditanstalt-bankverein . trude , her mother , a pianist and budapest native , had come from an upper-class hungarian jewish family . she had converted to catholicism and was described as a `` practicing christian '' who raised her daughter as a christian , although hedy was not formally baptized at the time . : <integer> as a child , lamarr showed an interest in acting and was fascinated by theatre and film . at the age of <integer> , she won a beauty contest in vienna . she also began to associate invention with her father , who would take her out on walks , explaining how various technologies in society functioned . : c. 7m > 05s–8m00s young hedy attended a private school , where she received piano , ballet , language and natural sciences lessons . after the anschluss , she helped get her mother , gertrude , out of austria , via canada to the united states . gertrude kiesler later became an american citizen ( despite her conversion , gertrude kiesler put `` hebrew '' as her race on her petition for naturalization , a term that had been frequently used in europe ) . one of hedy 's paternal aunts , frimet pines ( née kiesler ) , died at theresienstadt , a hybrid concentration camp and ghetto , during the holocaust . the fate of other relatives is unknown . == european film career == === early work === lamarr was taking acting classes in vienna when one day , she forged a note from her mother and went to sascha-film and was able to get herself hired as a script girl . while there , she was able to get a role as an extra in money on the street ( <year> ) , and then a small speaking part in storm in a water glass ( <year> ) . producer max reinhardt then cast her in a play entitled the weaker sex , which was performed at the theater in der josefstadt . reinhardt was so impressed with her that he brought her with him back to berlin.however , she never actually trained with reinhardt or appeared in any of his berlin productions . instead , she met the russian theatre producer alexis granowsky , who cast her in his film directorial debut , the trunks of mr. o.f . ( <year> ) , starring walter abel and peter lorre . granowsky soon moved to paris , but lamarr stayed in berlin and was given the lead role in no money needed ( <year> ) , a comedy directed by carl boese . lamarr then starred in the film which made her internationally famous . === ecstasy === in early <year> , at age <integer> , lamarr was given the lead in gustav machatý 's film ecstasy ( ekstase in german , extase in czech ) . she played the neglected young wife of an indifferent older man . the film became both celebrated and notorious for showing lamarr 's face in the throes of orgasm as well as close-up and brief nude scenes , a result of her being `` duped '' by the director and producer , who used high-power telephoto lenses.although she was dismayed and now disillusioned about taking other roles , the film gained world recognition after winning an award in rome . throughout europe , it was regarded an artistic work . in america it was considered overly sexual and received negative publicity , especially among women 's groups . it was banned there and in germany . === withdrawal === lamarr played a number of stage roles , including a starring one in sissy , a play about empress elisabeth of austria produced in vienna . it won accolades from critics . admirers sent roses to her dressing room and tried to get backstage to meet her . she sent most of them away , including a man who was more insistent , friedrich mandl . he became obsessed with getting to know her.mandl was an austrian military arms merchant and munitions manufacturer who was reputedly the third-richest man in austria . she fell for his charming and fascinating personality , partly due to his immense financial wealth . her parents , both of jewish descent , did not approve , due to mandl 's ties to italian fascist leader benito mussolini , and later , german führer adolf hitler , but they could not stop the headstrong lamarr.on august <days> , <year> , lamarr married mandl at the karlische . she was <integer> years old and he was <integer> . in her autobiography ecstasy and me , she described mandl as an extremely controlling husband who strongly objected to her simulated orgasm scene in ecstasy and prevented her from pursuing her acting career . she claimed she was kept a virtual prisoner in their castle home , schloss schwarzenau . mandl had close social and business ties to the italian government , selling munitions to the country , and although like hedy , his own father was jewish , had ties to the nazi regime of germany , as well . lamarr wrote that the dictators of both countries attended lavish parties at the mandl home . lamarr accompanied mandl to business meetings , where he conferred with scientists and other professionals involved in military technology . these conferences were her introduction to the field of applied science and nurtured her latent talent in science.lamarr 's marriage to mandl eventually became unbearable , and she decided to separate herself from both her husband and country in <year> . in her autobiography , she wrote that she disguised herself as her maid and fled to paris , but by other accounts , she persuaded mandl to let her wear all of her jewelry for a dinner party , then disappeared afterward . she writes about her marriage : i knew very soon that i could never be an actress while i was his wife . ... he was the absolute monarch in his marriage . ... i was like a doll . i was like a thing , some object of art which had to be guarded—and imprisoned—having no mind , no life of its own . == hollywood career == === louis b. mayer and mgm === after arriving in london in <year> , she met louis b. mayer , head of mgm , who was scouting for talent in europe . she initially turned down the offer he made her ( of $ <integer> a week ) , but then booked herself onto the same new york bound liner as him , and managed to impress him enough to secure a $ <integer> a week contract . mayer persuaded her to change her name to hedy lamarr ( to distance herself from her real identity , and `` the ecstasy lady '' reputation associated with it ) , choosing the surname in homage to the beautiful silent film star , barbara la marr , on the suggestion of his wife , who admired la marr . he brought her to hollywood in <year> and began promoting her as the `` world 's most beautiful woman '' .mayer loaned lamarr to producer walter wanger , who was making algiers ( <year> ) , an american version of the french film , pépé le moko ( <year> ) . lamarr was cast in the lead opposite charles boyer . the film created a `` national sensation '' , says shearer . : <integer> she was billed as an unknown but well-publicized austrian actress , which created anticipation in audiences . mayer hoped she would become another greta garbo or marlene dietrich . : <integer> according to one viewer , when her face first appeared on the screen , `` everyone gasped ... lamarr 's beauty literally took one 's breath away . `` : <integer> in future hollywood films , she was invariably typecast as the archetypal glamorous seductress of exotic origin . her second american film was to be i take this woman , co-starring with spencer tracy under the direction of regular dietrich collaborator , josef von sternberg . von sternberg was fired during the shoot , replaced by frank borzage . the film was put on hold , and lamarr was put into lady of the tropics ( <year> ) , where she played a mixed-race seductress in saigon opposite robert taylor . she returned to i take this woman , re-shot by w. s. van dyke . the resulting film was a flop . far more popular was boom town ( <year> ) with clark gable , claudette colbert and spencer tracy ; it made $ <integer> million . mgm promptly reteamed lamarr and gable in comrade x ( <year> ) , a comedy film in the vein of ninotchka ( <year> ) , which was another hit . lamarr was teamed with james stewart in come live with me ( <year> ) , playing a viennese refugee . stewart was also in ziegfeld girl ( <year> ) , where lamarr , judy garland and lana turner played aspiring showgirls - a big success.lamarr was top-billed in h. m. pulham , esq . ( <year> ) , although the film 's protagonist was the title role played by robert young . she made a third film with tracy , tortilla flat ( <year> ) . it was successful at the box office , as was crossroads ( <year> ) with william powell . lamarr played the seductive native girl tondelayo in white cargo ( <year> ) , top billed over walter pidgeon . it was a huge hit . white cargo contains arguably her most memorable film quote , delivered with provocative invitation : `` i am tondelayo . i make tiffin for you ? '' this line typifies many of lamarr 's roles , which emphasized her beauty and sensuality while giving her relatively few lines . the lack of acting challenges bored lamarr . she reportedly took up inventing to relieve her boredom.she was reunited with powell in a comedy the heavenly body ( <year> ) , then was borrowed by warner bros for the conspirators ( <year> ) . this was an attempt to repeat the success of casablanca ( <year> ) , and rko borrowed her for a melodrama experiment perilous ( <year> ) . back at mgm lamarr was teamed with robert walker in the romantic comedy her highness and the bellboy ( <year> ) , playing a princess who falls in love with a new yorker . it was very popular , but would be the last film she made under her mgm contract.her off-screen life and personality during those years was quite different from her screen image . she spent much of her time feeling lonely and homesick . she might swim at her agent 's pool , but shunned the beaches and staring crowds . when asked for an autograph , she wondered why anyone would want it . writer howard sharpe interviewed her and gave his impression : hedy has the most incredible personal sophistication . she knows the peculiarly european art of being womanly ; she knows what men want in a beautiful woman , what attracts them , and she forces herself to be these things . she has magnetism with warmth , something that neither dietrich nor garbo has managed to achieve . author richard rhodes describes her assimilation into american culture : of all the european émigrés who escaped nazi germany and nazi austria , she was one of the very few who succeeded in moving to another culture and becoming a full-fledged star herself . there were so very few who could make the transition linguistically or culturally . she really was a resourceful human being–i think because of her father 's strong influence on her as a child . lamarr also had a penchant for speaking about herself in the third person . === wartime fundraiser === lamarr wanted to join the national inventors council , but was reportedly told by nic member charles f. kettering and others that she could better help the war effort by using her celebrity status to sell war bonds.she participated in a war bond-selling campaign with a sailor named eddie rhodes . rhodes was in the crowd at each lamarr appearance , and she would call him up on stage . she would briefly flirt with him before asking the audience if she should give him a kiss . the crowd would say yes , to which hedy would reply that she would if enough people bought war bonds . after enough bonds were purchased , she would kiss rhodes and he would head back into the audience . then they would head off to the next war bond rally . === producer === after leaving mgm in <year> , lamarr formed a production company with jack chertok and made the thriller the strange woman ( <year> ) . it went over budget and only made minor profits.she and chertok then made dishonored lady ( <year> ) , another thriller starring lamarr , which also went over budget - but was not a commercial success . she tried a comedy with robert cummings , let 's live a little ( <year> ) . === later films === lamarr enjoyed her biggest success playing delilah against victor mature as the biblical strongman in cecil b. demille 's samson and delilah , the highest-grossing film of <year> . the film also won two oscars.lamarr returned to mgm for a film noir with john hodiak , a lady without passport ( <year> ) , which flopped . more popular were two pictures she made at paramount , a western with ray milland , copper canyon ( <year> ) , and a bob hope spy spoof , my favorite spy ( <year> ) . her career went into decline . she went to italy to play multiple roles in loves of three queens ( <year> ) , which she also produced . however she lacked the experience necessary to make a success of such an epic production , and lost millions of dollars when she was unable to secure distribution of the picture . she was joan of arc in irwin allen 's critically panned epic , the story of mankind ( <year> ) and did episodes of zane grey theatre ( `` proud woman '' ) and shower of stars ( `` cloak and dagger '' ) . her last film was a thriller the female animal ( <year> ) . lamarr was signed to act in the <year> film picture mommy dead , but was let go when she collapsed during filming from nervous exhaustion . she was replaced in the role of jessica flagmore shelley by zsa zsa gabor . == inventor == although lamarr had no formal training and was primarily self-taught , she worked in her spare time on various hobbies and inventions , which included an improved traffic stoplight and a tablet that would dissolve in water to create a carbonated drink . the beverage was unsuccessful ; lamarr herself said it tasted like alka-seltzer . among the few who knew of lamarr 's inventiveness was aviation tycoon howard hughes . she suggested he change the rather square design of his aeroplanes ( which she thought looked too slow ) to a more streamlined shape , based on pictures of the fastest birds and fish she could find . lamarr discussed her relationship with hughes during an interview , saying that while they dated , he actively supported her `` tinkering '' hobbies . he put his team of scientists and engineers at her disposal , saying they would do or make anything she asked for.during world war ii , lamarr learned that radio-controlled torpedoes , an emerging technology in naval war , could easily be jammed and set off course . she thought of creating a frequency-hopping signal that could not be tracked or jammed . she contacted her friend , composer and pianist george antheil , to help her develop a device for doing that , and he succeeded by synchronizing a miniaturized player-piano mechanism with radio signals . they drafted designs for the frequency-hopping system , which they patented . antheil recalled : we began talking about the war , which , in the late summer of <year> , was looking most extremely black . hedy said that she did not feel very comfortable , sitting there in hollywood and making lots of money when things were in such a state . she said that she knew a good deal about munitions and various secret weapons ... and that she was thinking seriously of quitting mgm and going to washington , dc , to offer her services to the newly established inventors ' council . their invention was granted a patent under us patent 2,292,387 on august <days> , <year> ( filed using her married name hedy kiesler markey ) . however , it was technologically difficult to implement , and at that time the u.s. navy was not receptive to considering inventions coming from outside the military . in <year> ( at the time of the cuban missile crisis ) , an updated version of their design at last appeared on navy ships.in <year> , lamarr and antheil received the electronic frontier foundation pioneer award and the bulbie gnass spirit of achievement bronze award , given to individuals whose creative lifetime achievements in the arts , sciences , business , or invention fields have significantly contributed to society . lamarr was featured on the science channel and the discovery channel . in <year> , lamarr and antheil were posthumously inducted into the national inventors hall of fame . == later years == lamarr became a naturalized citizen of the united states at age <integer> on april <days> , <year> . her autobiography , ecstasy and me , was published in <year> , although she said on tv that it was not written by her , and much of it was fictional . lamarr later sued the publisher , saying that many details were fabricated by its ghost writer , leo guild . lamarr , in turn , was sued by gene ringgold , who asserted that the book plagiarized material from an article he had written in <year> for screen facts magazine.in the late 1950s lamarr designed and , with then-husband w. howard lee , developed the villa lamarr ski resort in aspen , colorado.in <year> , lamarr was arrested in los angeles for shoplifting . the charges were eventually dropped . in <year> , she was arrested on the same charge in florida , this time for stealing $ 21.48 worth of laxatives and eye drops . she pleaded no contest to avoid a court appearance , and the charges were dropped in return for her promise to refrain from breaking any laws for a year . the shoplifting charges coincided with a failed attempt to return to the screen . the 1970s were a decade of increasing seclusion for lamarr . she was offered several scripts , television commercials , and stage projects , but none piqued her interest . in <year> , she filed a $ <integer> million lawsuit against warner bros. , claiming that the running parody of her name ( `` hedley lamarr '' ) in the mel brooks comedy blazing saddles infringed her right to privacy . brooks said he was flattered ; the studio settled out of court for an undisclosed nominal sum and an apology to lamarr for `` almost using her name '' . brooks said that lamarr `` never got the joke '' . with her eyesight failing , lamarr retreated from public life and settled in miami beach , florida , in 1981.a large corel-drawn image of lamarr won coreldraw 's yearly software suite cover design contest in <year> . for several years , beginning in <year> , it was featured on boxes of the software suite . lamarr sued the company for using her image without her permission . corel countered that she did not own rights to the image . the parties reached an undisclosed settlement in 1998.for her contribution to the motion picture industry , lamarr has a star on the hollywood walk of fame at <year> hollywood blvd adjacent to vine street where the walk is centered . lamarr became estranged from her older son , james lamarr loder , when he was <integer> years old . their relationship ended abruptly , and he moved in with another family . they did not speak again for almost <integer> years . lamarr left james loder out of her will , and he sued for control of the us $ 3.3 million estate left by lamarr in <year> . he eventually settled for us $ 50,000 . === seclusion === in the last decades of her life , the telephone became lamarr 's only means of communication with the outside world , even with her children and close friends . she often talked up to six or seven hours a day on the phone , but she spent hardly any time with anyone in person in her final years . a documentary , calling hedy lamarr , was released in <year> and featured her children , anthony loder and denise loder-deluca . === death === lamarr died in casselberry , florida , on january <days> , <year> , of heart disease , aged <integer> . her son anthony loder spread her ashes in austria 's vienna woods in accordance with her last wishes.in <year> a memorial to lamarr was unveiled in vienna 's central cemetery . == awards == hedy lamarr was honored with a star on the hollywood walk of fame in 1960.in <year> , lamarr was selected the `` most promising new actress '' of <year> in a poll of area voters conducted by philadelphia record film critic . british moviegoers voted hedy lamarr the year 's 10th best actress , for her performance in samson and delilah in 1951.in <year> , lamarr and george antheil were jointly honored with the electronic frontier foundation 's pioneer award and lamarr also was the first woman to receive the invention convention 's bulbie gnass spirit of achievement award , known as the `` oscars of inventing '' . the following year , lamarr 's native austria awarded her the viktor kaplan medal of the austrian association of patent holders and inventors.in <year> , the hedy-lamarr-weg was founded in vienna meidling ( 12th district ) , named after the actress . in <year> , the iqoqi installed a quantum telescope on the roof of the university of vienna , which they name after her in 2014.in <year> , lamarr was posthumously inducted into the national inventors hall of fame for frequency-hopping spread spectrum technology . the same year , anthony loder 's request that the remaining ashes of his mother should be buried in an honorary grave of the city of vienna was realized . on november <days> , her urn was buried at the vienna central cemetery in group <integer> g , tomb no . <integer> , not far from the centrally located presidential tomb.on november <days> , <year> , google honored her on her 101st birthday with a doodle.on august <days> , <year> , an asteroid was named after her : <integer> lamarr == marriages and children == lamarr was married and divorced six times and had three children : friedrich mandl ( married 1933–1937 ) , chairman of the hirtenberger patronen-fabrik gene markey ( married 1939–1941 ) , screenwriter and producer . she adopted a child , james lamarr markey ( born january <days> , <year> ) during her marriage with markey .

genetics , artificial intelligence , and the united states space program . he was <integer> years old when he won the <year> nobel prize in physiology or medicine for discovering that bacteria can mate and exchange genes ( bacterial conjugation ) . he shared the prize with edward tatum and george beadle , who won for their work with genetics . in addition to his contributions to biology , lederberg did extensive research in artificial intelligence . this included work in the nasa experimental programs seeking life on mars and the chemistry expert system dendral . == early life and education == lederberg was born in montclair , new jersey , to a jewish family , son of esther goldenbaum schulman lederberg and rabbi zvi hirsch lederberg , in <year> , and moved to washington heights , manhattan as an infant . he had two younger brothers . lederberg graduated from stuyvesant high school in new york city at the age of <integer> in <year> . after graduation , he was allowed lab space as part of the american institute science laboratory , a forerunner of the westinghouse science talent search . he enrolled in columbia university in <year> , majoring in zoology . under the mentorship of francis j. ryan , he conducted biochemical and genetic studies on the bread mold neurospora crassa . intending to receive his md and fulfill his military service obligations , lederberg worked as a hospital corpsman during <year> in the clinical pathology laboratory at st. albans naval hospital , where he examined sailors ' blood and stool samples for malaria . he went on to receive his undergraduate degree in <year> . == bacterial genetics == joshua lederberg began medical studies at columbia 's college of physicians and surgeons while continuing to perform experiments . inspired by oswald avery 's discovery of the importance of dna , lederberg began to investigate his hypothesis that , contrary to prevailing opinion , bacteria did not simply pass down exact copies of genetic information , making all cells in a lineage essentially clones . after making little progress at columbia , lederberg wrote to edward tatum , ryan 's post-doctoral mentor , proposing a collaboration . in <year> and <year> , lederberg took a leave of absence to study under the mentorship of tatum at yale university . lederberg and tatum showed that the bacterium escherichia coli entered a sexual phase during which it could share genetic information through bacterial conjugation . with this discovery and some mapping of the e. coli chromosome , lederberg was able to receive his ph.d. from yale university in <year> . joshua married esther miriam zimmer ( herself a student of edward tatum ) on december <days> , <year> . instead of returning to columbia to finish his medical degree , lederberg chose to accept an offer of an assistant professorship in genetics at the university of wisconsin–madison . his wife esther lederberg went with him to wisconsin . she received her doctorate there in <year> . joshua lederberg and norton zinder showed in <year> that genetic material could be transferred from one strain of the bacterium salmonella typhimurium to another using viral material as an intermediary step . this process is called transduction . in <year> , m. laurance morse , esther lederberg and joshua lederberg also discovered specialized transduction . the research in specialized transduction focused upon lambda phage infection of e. coli . transduction and specialized transduction explained how bacteria of different species could gain resistance to the same antibiotic very quickly . during her time in joshua lederberg 's laboratory , esther lederberg also discovered fertility factor f , later publishing with joshua lederberg

'' “ the current soviet account is very likely to be true . '' after the fall of the soviet union and subsequent us investigations in the early <year> 's a team of scientists confirmed the outbreak was caused by a release of an aerosol of anthrax pathogen from a nearby military facility , the lab leak is one of the deadliest ever ever documented . == awards and accolades == the benjamin franklin medal for distinguished achievement in the sciences of the american philosophical society , <year> . the presidential medal of freedom , <year> . in lederberg 's honor , the <integer> km diameter large impact crater in xanthe terra on the surface of mars was named in the year <year> . == personal == lederberg married fellow scientist esther miriam zimmer in <year> ; they divorced in <year> . he married psychiatrist marguerite stein kirsch in <year> . he was survived by marguerite , their daughter , anne lederberg , and his stepson , david kirsch . == see also == list of jewish nobel laureates lcf notation == references == == external links == joshua lederberg papers ( 1904–2008 ) - national library of medicine finding aid the joshua lederberg papers - profiles in science , national library of medicine joshua lederberg on nobelprize.org in memoriam : joshua lederberg ( 1925–2008 ) national academy of sciences biographical memoir center for oral history . `` joshua lederberg '' . science history institute . bohning , james j .

'' == education == kronrod was born in moscow . growing up , he studied math with d. o. shklyarsky in school and in <year> entered the department of mechanics and mathematics at moscow state university . he did his first independent mathematical work as a freshman with professor a. o. gel'fond . kronrod was honored as a student with the first prize of the moscow mathematical society and was the only person to win the prize twice . during world war ii he was rejected for military service because at the time graduate level students were exempt . they did help to build trenches around moscow , and when he returned , kronrod reapplied and was accepted . he served twice , and was injured twice . he was awarded several medals , including order of the red star and order of the patriotic war . the second injury in <year> hospitalised him for a year and he was discharged from the army in <year> . this injury made him an invalid of sorts for life . kronrod was married and about this time his son was born . during next four years he continued his studies at the university , simultaneously working at the atomic energy kurchatov institute . there he chose to leave pure mathematics and pursue computational mathematics . in his last undergraduate year , kronrod studied with nikolai luzin the teacher of many of the soviet union 's finest scientists . kronrod and georgy adelson-velsky were colleagues and luzin 's last students . like his teacher , kronrod led a series of supplementary seminars for younger mathematics students . unusually for the time , instead of students merely reporting on the content of courses , kronrod made his students undertake training exercises , even proving basic theorems themselves . the preparation required for this reduced the numbers of participants , but those who remained , including r. a. minlos and a. g. vitushkin , derived great benefit . vitushkin described him as `` witty and friendly '' . at his own request , kronrod was called simply `` sasha '' by his students . he was considered to be a prophet in his field . the kronod circle met between <year> and <year> . kronrod 's position was formally at the institute of physics , which meant that his students had to register with other advisers , accounting for the decline of the circle into a series of friendly meetings . when he defended thesis in <year> , his committee including m. v. keldish , a. n. kolmogorov and d. e. men'shov bypassed the candidate of sciences degree and awarded him a doctor of sciences degree in the physical-mathematical sciences . kronrod taught at the moscow pedagogical institute . yevgeniy landis was a student , early collaborator and one of his biographers . during the 1960s he worked on mathematics education in high schools by organizing courses and teaching methods . == computer science == kronod played an important role in building the first major russian computer , relay computer <other> , though he liked to say his colleague n.i . bessonov was the sole inventor . at the moscow institute for theoretical and experimental physics ( itef or itep ) during 1950–1955 kronod collaborated with physicists , among them isaak pomeranchuk and lev landau . for providing theoretical physics with numerical solutions he received the stalin prize and an order of the red banner . in <year> , he first used an electronic computer at the krzhizhanovskii laboratory of the institute of energy of the russian academy of sciences , later called the institute for electronic control machines . he directed the mathematics division of itep . they could surpass the results achieved outside the ussr by far faster machines , in the case of cern in geneva , five hundred times faster . requests for computation were analyzed and sometimes solved by other means . the equipment was maintained and there were almost no hardware malfunctions . a policy said finished programs had to be re-examined if they ran for more than ten minutes . kronrod rewarded accuracy . he held what today are controversial views on the role of gender in computing . he employed women in itep 's coding and card punching groups , believing that female computing staff members are more accurate than males . he also believed that in order to think , the male scientists qualified to use the computers needed to be free from operating them . the women did the input and quality assurance side by side with the men and for each month without an error received a <integer> % raise in salary . he applied computing resources to the ussr planned economy and to cancer research . he served with leonid kantorovich and others on a cabinet ministry commission and oversaw the computation of the country 's material expenditures to correct price formation . kronrod 's student v. d. belkin further developed this work . at the gertsen cancer research institute during the 1960s , with his student p. e. kunin he studied the differential diagnostics of lung cancer and pneumonia to help doctors determine when surgery is needed . == artificial intelligence == kronrod had a profound interest in artificial intelligence known in the ussr at the time as heuristic programming . he is well known for saying , `` chess is the drosophila of artificial intelligence . '' this quote graces the top of the american association for artificial intelligence `` games & puzzles '' chess home page.in <year> , itep challenged and in 1966–1967 defeated the american chess program kotok-mccarthy . the developers included adelson-velsky who used a.l . brudno 's adversarial search algorithm and a `` general recursive search scheme '' by kronrod . they were advised by russian chess master a.r . bitman and world champion mikhail botvinnik in what was the first test of shannon brute force vs. selective search.kronrod 's participation came at great cost . the physics users at itep complained , thinking that the lab was being used for game playing , when the division was writing the crazy eights card game and chess trying to teach a machine to think . == end of a career == when the communist party reprimanded him in <year> for cosigning a letter with many mathematicians in defense of the mathematician and logician alexander esenin-volpin , a son of the poet sergei esenin , the physicists were able to oust him from itep . he was also fired from his professorship.he then directed the mathematics laboratory at the central scientific research institute of patent information ( cniipi ) where he proposed patent reform to stimulate inventions . after gaining support he lost this position to an unsympathetic director . his last position was heading a central geophysical expedition laboratory that processed drilling data where he made calculations for gas and oil exploration , but he was not challenged by this work . he re-examined his goals and soon changed course . == medicine == kronrod decided that his best work was to help others and most importantly the terminally ill . he spent his fortune developing milil from a sour milk extract for cancer patients , to fill a shortage of anabol , an expensive drug developed in small quantities by his acquaintance bogdanov in bulgaria . he was promised but never acquired an animal testing laboratory so he tested the medicine on himself . kronrod had no medical degree but he was well-informed in medicine . milil was a last resort for seriously ill patients and was administered by physicians in one case in a hospital ward a.a. vishnevskiy reserved for treatments by kronrod 's method . kronrod himself never gave the drug to patients and through physicians gave it away free . the drug was unapproved and a criminal case was brought against him . he regained his research records when a relative of the plaintiff required milil for treatment and the case was dismissed . he slowly recovered when a stroke took his speech and ability to read and write but was forced to resign at the central geophysical expedition and stop all work on math . he saved his own life by asking to be soaked in a tub of very hot water for several hours after a second stroke . he died on <integer> october <year> of a third stroke . == notes == == references == e. m. landis , i. m. yaglom ( <year> ) . `` about aleksandr semenovich kronrod '' . russian math . surveys . <integer> ( <integer> ) : 993–1007 . <other> .

columbia university for most of his active life . == biography == born in tomaszów lubelski , poland , mincer survived world war ii prison camps in czechoslovakia and germany as a teenager . after graduating from emory university in <year> , mincer received his ph.d. from columbia university in <year> . following teaching stints at city college of new york , hebrew university , stockholm school of economics and the university of chicago , mincer joined columbia 's faculty in <year> . he stayed at columbia until his retirement in <year> . mincer was also a member of the national bureau of economic research from <year> through his death . mincer died at his manhattan home on august <days> , <year> , due to complications from parkinson 's disease , according to his wife , dr. flora mincer , and his daughters , deborah mincer ( sussman ) and carolyn mincer . == contributions to economic science == mincer was considered by many to be a father of modern labor economics . as a leading member of a group of economists known as the chicago school of economics , mincer and nobel laureate gary becker helped to develop the empirical foundations of human capital theory , consequently revolutionizing the field of labor economics . during his academic career , mincer authored four books and hundreds of journal articles , papers and essays . mincer 's ground-breaking work : schooling , experience and earnings , published in <year> , used data from the <year> and <year> censuses to relate income distribution in america to the varying amounts of education and on-the-job training among workers . `` he calculated , for example , that annual earnings rose by <integer> to <integer> percent in the 1950s and 1960s for every year of additional schooling . there was a similar , although smaller , return on investment in job training—and age played a role . `` mincer 's work continues to have a profound impact on the field of labor economics . papers in the field frequently use mincerian equations , which model wages as a function of human capital in statistical estimation . and as a result of mincer 's pioneering work , variables such as schooling and work experience are now the most commonly used measures of human capital . == awards and prizes == in <year> mincer was elected as a fellow of the american statistical association.in <year> , he received an honorary doctor of laws degree from the university of chicago which recognized his seminal work in the economic analysis of earnings and inequality , the labor force decisions of women and of job mobility . the citation for the degree also recognized mincer 's work in this area that has helped guide a generation of economists who study these important social questions . in recognition of his lifetime achievements in economics , mincer was awarded the first iza prize in labor economics of the institute for the study of labor ( bonn , germany ) . the $ 50,000 prize was presented to mincer by more than <integer> of his former students and colleagues at a conference at columbia university in <year> . in <year> mincer received a career achievement award from the society of labor economists ; the annual award has subsequently become known as the mincer award . mincer was never awarded a nobel prize , though he was considered one of the world 's greatest economists of the 20th century , and was nominated for the award numerous times by admiring colleagues . == quotes regarding mincer == .. the decade jacob and i spent working together was surely one of the most , if not the most exciting and fruitful in my life . the close blending of theory and data represented in mincer 's work has shaped the direction of labor economics and influenced and inspired all those who have followed him . his very simple formulation basically fits the data for understanding how earnings are related to educational attainment in virtually every country in every time period . == selected

professor . he taught at harvard medical school for nearly fifty years and was the first african-american department chair of the school . == early life == amos was born in pennsauken , new jersey to howard r. amos sr. , a philadelphia postman , and iola johnson . iola johnson was adopted and educated by a philadelphia quaker family . due to the close relationship between iola and the quaker family , the amos family received a lot of books , including a biography of louis pasteur . excelling as a student , amos graduated in <year> at the top of his class from camden high school in new jersey . he attended springfield college in massachusetts on a full academic scholarship . in <year> he graduated with a degree in chemistry . == military service == amos was drafted into the us army in <year> , serving carrots in the quartermaster 's corps in world war ii as a warrant officer . during his time in the army , he travelled along the coast of france where he eventually started speaking very fluently in the language while becoming an expert on the foods and wines . eventually he was discharged <days> february <year> , where he began to start his next career in the program of biological science at harvard university . == career == <days> september <year> , springfield college hired him as a biology professor . dr. amos was the college ’ s first african american faculty member . amos was awarded a m.a . in <year> and a ph.d. in <year> from harvard medical school . he was a graduate student with howard j. mueller . harold thesis was on the infectivity of herpes virus . after graduating , he was awarded a fulbright scholarship that took him to the pasteur institute for two years . amos joined the harvard medical school faculty in <year> , working as a teacher . he was the chairman of the bacteriology department from <year> to <year> and again from <year> to <year> . in <year> , he was named the maude and lillian presley professor of microbiology and molecular genetics . he was a presidential advisor to richard nixon , a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences ( <year> ) , the institute of medicine and the american association for the advancement of science . in <year> amos received professor emeritus status . amos was awarded the national academy of sciences ' public welfare medal in <year> and the harvard centennial medal in <year> . he directed the minority medical faculty development program ( mmfdp ) of the robert wood johnson foundation after his retirement from harvard . a diversity award at harvard medical school is named after amos . he inspired hundreds of minorities to become medical doctors . he was well known as an inviting and welcoming mentor to both students and junior faculty members . == awards == howard university ’ s dr. charles r. drew world medical prize in <year> national academy of sciences ' public welfare medal in <year> harvard centennial medal in <year> == publications == harold amos research was mostly recognized on the work about his bacterial metabolism , nutrition , animal cell culture , virology , and the effects of hormones . during his time at harvard university he began working on a thesis on virology that was affecting herpes virus that was experimented on chick 's chorioallantoic membrane which led to his big break from fulbright fellowship that supported his work on mutation of the e. coli bacteria which led to amos 's research focused on using cells in culture to understand how molecules get into cells and how entry is regulated during cell starvation or in plentiful conditions . amos published over seventy scientific papers . as part of the department of chair for bacteriology and immunology one his famous studies was research over the animal cells that was focused on the rna metabolism that broke down the enzyme inductions and their functions that were later published in his book called harvard gazette that focused on the glucose starvation , hexose metabolism and transport . == harold amos medical faculty program == `` the mission of the robert wood johnson foundation is to improve the health and health care of all americans . since its inception , the foundation has supported efforts to improve the number and quality of minority health care professionals . recognizing that there was an existing pool of talented minority medical residents who had the potential to become medical school faculty members , and that a critical requirement for success was for those potential academicians to forge links with appropriate mentors who have exemplary track records in producing outstanding medical faculty , the foundation developed the minority medical faculty development program in <year> ( renamed the harold amos medical faculty development program , or amfdp , in <year> in honor of its first director ) . `` the ideas of this program believed that his role to the university of harvard was to help push the narrative of many minority students that were n't able to gain support to pursue a medical career as a physician . by the facility and board directors supporting harold in this regime it has shown an increase of many minority students that have exceeded the numbers of non minority faculty . in regards of the program harold amos believed with this program it would allow students to gain the opportunities like himself while passing on his knowledge to other students in the program . as for today his program has changed nearly over <integer> participants in the years of <other> <year> that were ( <integer> scholars and <integer> non scholars ) that were able to gain leadership qualities plus grants that were covering at least <other> of the semester while there in the program.in regards of program the most known alumni was man named dr. james gavin iii quoted `` it has been an immeasurable honor to play a part in realizing the harold amos program ’ s goal of building and developing a cadre of brilliant young physicians and dentists who go on to make significant contributions to the field of academic medicine . our scholars and alumni make up one of the richest endowments of human capital with which i have ever been affiliated . being part of that for three decades has helped fulfill my commitment to develop programs that create sustainable , positive change . '' by the help of this program dr. gavin believed that this committee helped him establish a great relationship between him and the facility that was able to advocate the workforce for many minorities that were capable to be a part of the growing medical regime . == references == == external links == tribute at the harvard medical school harvard gazette obituary harold amos papers , <other> . hms

ukrainian-soviet ecologist and zoologist . he was a full member ( academician ) of the russian academy of sciences . == biography == shwarts was born in the city of dnipropetrovsk ( ukraine ) . in <year> he entered the department of biology at the leningrad university . because of world war ii he graduated in <year> . in <year> he presented his phd thesis . having received his doctorate degree ( russian degree called candidat nauk ) he moved to sverdlovsk ( now yekaterinburg ) . all his scientific life was linked with the institute of biology ( now institute of plant and animal ecology ) in yekaterinburg where he defended his second thesis and became doctor of science in <year> . in <year> he stood at the head of this institute and made it one of the most prolific centers of ecology in the world . he also kept a professorship at the ural state university . shwarts contributed into the evolution theory and chemical ecology of the sea fauna and proposed his own definition of the notion of population which enriched the ecological niche theory . he studied the relation between a human and the biosphere , he developed special methods for investigations in the ecology and was one of those scientists who argued the necessity of human ecology as a part of biology . in particular he developed the morphophisilogical indicators method in population ecology having incorporated the ecology into the evolution theory . shwarts owned a horse named horsington . stanislav shwarts was the author of <integer> publications . == rewards == full member of the russian academy of sciences (

public intellectual who was the sir john hicks professor of economics at the london school of economics from 1970–88 . he was also professor at osaka university and member of the british academy . in <year> he won the order of culture ( 文化勲章 , bunka-kunshō ) . == career == originally desiring a career as a historical novelist , at the university morishima pursued social science , studying both economics and sociology under yasuma takada . at kyoto university , morishima was rigorously trained in both mainstream neoclassical economic theory and marxian economics . mathematically gifted , in <year> , he graduated from kyoto university and taught there in addition to osaka university . he started institute of social and economic research ( iser ) of osaka university with yasuma takada . in <year> he established with nobel-laureate lawrence r. klein from the economics department of the university of pennsylvania the international economic review ( today published by penn ) , which grew to become one of the leading journals in economics in the world.in <year> , he became the first japanese president of the econometric society . by all accounts , john hicks was a committed advocate of morishima 's careership in england . in <year> , he immigrated to britain , teaching at university of essex , then accepting an endowed chair at the lse in <year> . later , he started the project that led to the establishment of the suntory-toyota foundation and the suntory and toyota international centres for economic and related disciplines ( sticerd ) at lse . he was sticerd 's first chairman . in <year> he was elected honorary fellow of the lse . == contributions == morishima 's three-volume work reinterpreting and synthesizing economic ideas in the major writings of david ricardo , karl marx , and léon walras , now largely forgotten , represents one of the high points of the radical political economy of the 1970s new left in north america . his intense interest in general equilibrium theory , classical political economy , and capitalism drove this work . based on lse lectures , these books worked towards the accommodation of von neumann 's <year> multi-sectoral growth model to a general equilibrium model . considering the work of these theorists to be ricardian , his three books worked to show that the modification of them along von neumann lines elucidates the theoretical similarities and differences between the positions . == academic positions == <year> – assistant at kyoto university <year> – lecturer at kyoto university <year> – assistant professor at kyoto

turned ugly . the government 's budget deficit increased tenfold , inflation approached <integer> percent , the unemployment rate doubled , and the current account went from positive to negative – the latter a critical problem in a country that rises or falls on foreign trade . despite economic difficulties , however , the government was able to enact a wide range of progressive social reforms , such as significant increases in welfare payments , the indexation of benefits and the minimum wage to contractual private sector wage developments , a system of rent rebates ( <year> ) , and a universal work incapacity insurance scheme ( <year> ) . the primary education act <days> october <year> gave more freedom to school heads regarding the programming of the curriculum , and an act <days> june <year> made supplementary benefits available to unemployed persons who accepted lower paid- work . in addition , a law <days> june <year> enabled employees aged sixty , two years after the

callaghan , was a british politician who served as prime minister of the united kingdom from <year> to <year> and leader of the labour party from <year> to <year> . callaghan is the only person to have held all four great offices of state , having served as chancellor of the exchequer from <year> to <year> , home secretary from <year> to <year> and foreign secretary from <year> to <year> . he was a member of parliament ( mp ) from <year> to <year> . born into a working class family in portsmouth , callaghan left school early and began his career as a tax inspector , before becoming a trade union official in the 1930s ; he served as a lieutenant in the royal navy during the second world war . he was elected to parliament at the <year> election , and was regarded as being on the left wing of the labour party . he was appointed to the attlee government as a parliamentary secretary in <year> , and began to move increasingly towards the right wing of the labour party , while maintaining his reputation as a `` keeper of the cloth cap '' – that is , seen as maintaining close ties between labour and the trade unions . following labour 's defeat at the <year> election , callaghan increasingly became regarded as the leader of the right wing of the labour party , and stood for the positions of deputy leader in <year> and for leader in <year> , but was defeated by george brown for the former and harold wilson for the latter . following labour 's victory at the <year> election , wilson appointed callaghan as chancellor of the exchequer ; this appointment coincided with a turbulent period for the british economy , during which callaghan had to tackle both a chronic balance of payments deficit and various speculative attacks on the pound sterling , with its exchange rate to other currencies being fixed by the bretton woods system . on <integer> november <year> , having initially denied that it would do so , the government devalued the pound sterling . in the wake of the decision , wilson moved callaghan to the role of home secretary . during this time , callaghan was responsible for overseeing the operations of the british army to support the police in northern ireland , following a request from the northern ireland government . callaghan remained in the shadow cabinet during labour 's period in opposition from <year> to <year> ; upon labour 's victory at the <year> election , wilson appointed callaghan as foreign secretary . callaghan was responsible for renegotiating the terms of britain 's membership of the european communities ( ec ) , and strongly supported the `` yes '' vote campaign in the <year> referendum , which confirmed the uk 's membership of the ec . when wilson suddenly announced his retirement <days> march <year> , callaghan defeated five other candidates to be elected leader of the labour party ; he was appointed prime minister on <integer> april <year> . despite winning a narrow majority in the house of commons at the <year> election , labour had lost this by the time callaghan became prime minister , and several by-election defeats and defections in his early months forced callaghan to strike a confidence and supply agreement with the liberal party . while this initially proved stable , in the wake of significant industrial disputes and widespread strikes in the 1978–79 `` winter of discontent '' , and the defeat of the referendum on devolution for scotland , led to minor parties joining the conservatives to pass a motion of no-confidence in callaghan on <integer> march <year> . although remaining personally popular in opinion polls , callaghan led labour to defeat at the <year> election and was replaced by margaret thatcher . callaghan initially remained as labour leader , serving as leader of the opposition until november <year> . he attempted to reform the process by which labour elected its leader . after leaving the leadership , he returned to the backbench , and between <year> and <year> was father of the house of commons . on retiring from the commons in <year> , he was elevated to the house of lords as baron callaghan of cardiff . he died on <integer> march <year> and remains to date the uk 's longest-lived former prime minister . == early life and career == leonard james callaghan was born at <integer> funtington road , copnor , portsmouth , england , on <integer> march <year> . he took his middle name from his father , james ( 1877–1921 ) , who was the son of an irish catholic father who had fled to england during the great irish famine , and a jewish mother . callaghan 's father ran away from home in the 1890s to join the royal navy ; as he was a year too young to enlist , he gave a false date of birth and changed his surname from garogher to callaghan , so that his true identity could not be traced . he rose to the rank of chief petty officer.his mother was charlotte callaghan ( née cundy , 1879–1961 ) an english baptist . as the catholic church at the time refused to marry catholics to members of other denominations , james callaghan senior abandoned catholicism and married charlotte in a baptist chapel . their first child was dorothy gertrude callaghan ( 1904–82 ) .james callaghan senior served in the first world war on board the battleship hms agincourt . after he was demobbed in <year> , he joined the coastguard and the family moved to the town of brixham in devon , but he died only two years later of a heart attack in <year> at the age of <integer> , leaving the family without an income , and forced to rely on charity to survive . their financial situation was improved in <year> when the first labour government was elected , and introduced changes allowing mrs callaghan to be granted a widow 's pension of ten shillings a week , on the basis that her husband 's death was partly due to his war service.in his early years , callaghan was known by his first name leonard . when he entered politics in <year> he decided to be known by his middle name james , and from then on he was referred to as james or jim . he attended portsmouth northern secondary school . he gained the senior oxford certificate in <year> , but could not afford entrance to university and instead sat the civil service entrance exam . at the age of <integer> , callaghan left to work as a clerk for the inland revenue at maidstone in kent . while working as a tax inspector , callaghan joined the maidstone branch of the labour party and the association of the officers of taxes ( aot ) , a trade union for those in his profession ; within a year of joining he became the office secretary of the union . in <year> he passed a civil service exam which enabled him to become a senior tax inspector , and that same year he became the kent branch secretary of the aot . the following year he was elected to the aot 's national executive council . in <year> , he was transferred to inland revenue offices in london . following a merger of unions in <year> , callaghan was appointed a full-time union official and to the post of assistant secretary of the inland revenue staff federation ( irsf ) , and resigned from his civil service duties.during his time working as a tax inspector in the <other> , callaghan met his future wife audrey moulton , and they were married <days> july <year> at maidstone.his union position at the irsf brought callaghan into contact with harold laski , the chairman of the labour party 's national executive committee and an academic at the london school of economics . laski encouraged him to stand for parliament , although later on he requested callaghan several times to study and lecture at the lse . following the outbreak of world war ii callaghan applied to join the royal navy in <year> , but was initially turned down on the basis that a trade union official was deemed to be a reserved occupation . he was finally allowed to join the royal navy volunteer reserve as an ordinary seaman in <year> . while he trained for his promotion his medical examination revealed that he was suffering from tuberculosis , so he was admitted to the royal naval hospital haslar in gosport near portsmouth . after he recovered , he was discharged and assigned to duties with the admiralty in whitehall . he was assigned to the japanese section and wrote a service manual for the royal navy the enemy : japan . he then served in the east indies fleet on board the escort carrier hms activity and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant <days> april <year> . as of <year> , callaghan remains the last british prime minister to be an armed forces veteran and the only one ever to have served in the royal navy . while on leave from the navy , callaghan was selected as a parliamentary candidate for cardiff south—he narrowly won the local party ballot with twelve votes against the next highest candidate george thomas , who received eleven . callaghan had been encouraged to put his name forward for the cardiff south seat by his friend dai kneath , a member of the irsf national executive from swansea , who was in turn an associate and friend of the local labour party secretary , bill headon.by <year> , he was serving on hms queen elizabeth in the indian ocean . after ve day , he returned , along with other prospective candidates , to the united kingdom to stand in the general election . == parliament and cabinet == the labour party won the overdue general election in a landslide victory on <integer> july <year> , bringing clement attlee to power , in charge of the first-ever majority labour government . callaghan won his cardiff south seat at the <year> uk general election ( and would hold a cardiff-area seat continuously until his retirement in <year> ) . he defeated the sitting conservative mp , sir arthur evans , by 17,489 votes to 11,545 . he campaigned on such issues as the rapid demobilisation of the armed forces and for a new housing construction programme . he stood on the left wing of the party , and was a vocal critic of the united states in <year> , joining <integer> other rebels in voting against accepting the anglo-american loan . callaghan did not join the keep left group of left-wing labour mps , but he did sign a letter in <year> with <integer> other mps from the group calling for a 'socialist foreign policy ' which would create an alternative to the ruthless capitalism of the united states and the totalitarian bolshevism of the ussr.callaghan was soon appointed parliamentary secretary to the ministry of transport in <year> where , advised by the young chief constable of hertfordshire , sir arthur young , his term saw important improvements in road safety , notably the introduction of zebra crossings , and an extension in the use of cat 's eyes . he moved to be parliamentary and financial secretary to the admiralty from <year> , where he was a delegate to the council of europe and resisted plans for a european army . callaghan was popular with labour mps , and was elected to the shadow cabinet every year while the labour party was in opposition from <year> to <year> . he was now a staunch gaitskellite on the labour right wing . he was parliamentary adviser to the police federation from <year> to <year> when he negotiated an increase in police pay with then-general secretary arthur charles evans . he ran for the deputy leadership of the party in <year> as an opponent of unilateral nuclear disarmament , and despite the other candidate of the labour right ( george brown ) agreeing with him on this policy , he forced brown to a second vote . <days> november <year> , callaghan became shadow chancellor . when hugh gaitskell died <days> january <year> , callaghan ran to succeed him , but came third in the leadership contest , which was won by harold wilson . however , he did gain the support of right-wingers , such as denis healey and anthony crosland , who wanted to prevent wilson from being elected leader but who also did not trust george brown . === chancellor of the exchequer , 1964–1967 === <days> october <year> , conservative prime minister sir alec douglas-home ( who had only been in power for twelve months since the resignation of harold macmillan ) was forced to call a general election , the parliament being about to expire . labour won a narrow majority , gaining <integer> seats for a total of <integer> to the conservatives ' <integer> . the new labour government under harold wilson immediately faced economic problems ; wilson acted within his first hours to appoint callaghan as the new chancellor of the exchequer . the previous chancellor , reginald maudling , had initiated fiscally expansionary measures which had helped create a pre-election economic boom ; by greatly increasing domestic demand this had caused imports to grow much faster than exports , thus when labour entered government they faced a balance of payments deficit of £800,000,000 ( equivalent to £16,574,300,000 in <year> ) , and an immediate sterling crisis . both wilson and callaghan took a strong stance against devaluation of sterling , partly due to the perception that the devaluation carried out by the previous labour government in <year> had contributed to that government 's downfall . the alternative to devaluation , however , was a series of austerity measures designed to reduce demand in the economy in order to reduce imports , and to stabilise the balance of payments and the value of sterling . just ten days after taking up his post , callaghan immediately introduced a <integer> % surcharge on imports , with the exception of foodstuffs and raw materials . this measure was intended to tackle the balance of payments deficit ; however , it caused an uproar amongst britain 's international trading partners . the outcry was so intense that it caused the government to announce that the surcharge was a temporary measure . callaghan later admitted in his autobiography that he could have handled the matter better , and in his haste to tackle the balance of payments problem , had failed to consult foreign governments.on <integer> november <days> callaghan gave his first budget and announced increases in income tax , petrol tax and the introduction of a new capital gains tax , actions which most economists deemed necessary to take the heat out of the balance and sterling deficit . in line with labour 's manifesto commitments , the budget also contained social measures to increase the state pension and the widows pension ; measures which were disliked by the city and speculators , causing a run on the pound . on <integer> november <days> it was decided to increase the bank rate from <integer> % to <integer> % , which generated a large amount of criticism . handling the situation was made more difficult by the attitude of lord cromer , the governor of the bank of england , who argued against the fiscal policies of the new labour government . when callaghan and wilson threatened to call a new general election , the governor soon raised a £3,000,000,000 loan to stabilise the reserves and the deficit.his second budget came on <integer> april <year> , in which he announced efforts to deflate the economy and reduce home import demand by £250,000,000 . shortly afterwards , the bank rate was reduced from <integer> % down to <integer> % . for a brief time , the economy and british financial market stabilised , allowing <days> june for callaghan to visit the united states and to discuss the state of the british economy with president lyndon b. johnson and the international monetary fund ( imf ) .in july <days> the pound came under extreme pressure and callaghan was forced to create harsh temporary measures to demonstrate control of the economy . these include delaying all current government building projects and postponing new pension plans . the alternative was to allow the pound to float or to devalue it . callaghan and wilson , however , were again adamant that a devaluation of the pound would create new social and economic problems and continued to take a firm stance against it . the government continued to struggle both with the economy and with the slender majority which , by <year> , had been reduced to one . on <integer> february <days> harold wilson formally announced an election for <integer> march <year> . on <integer> march <days> callaghan gave a 'little budget ' to the commons and announced the historic decision that the uk would adopt decimal currency . ( it was actually not until <year> , under a conservative government , that the united kingdom moved from the system of pounds , shillings and pence to a decimal system of <integer> pence to the pound . ) he also announced a short-term mortgage scheme which allowed low-wage earners to maintain mortgage schemes in the face of economic difficulties . soon afterwards , at the <year> general election , labour won <integer> seats compared to <integer> seats against the conservatives , giving the labour government an increased majority of <integer> seats.callaghan introduced his next budget on <integer> may <days> he had informed the house that he would bring a full budget to the house when he made his 'little budget ' speech prior to the election . the main point of his budget was the introduction of a selective employment tax , penalising the service industry and favouring the manufacturing industry . twelve days after the budget , the national union of seamen called a national strike and the problems facing sterling were multiplied . additional strikes caused the balance of payments deficit to increase . however , a £3,300,000,000 loan from swiss banks was due by the end of the year . on <integer> july <days> the bank rate was increased again to seven percent , and on <integer> july callaghan announced a ten-point emergency package to deal with the crisis which included further tax rises and a six-month freeze on wage increases . by early <year> , the economy had begun to stabilise once again with the balance of payments moving into equilibrium , the bank rate was reduced to <integer> % <days> march and 5.5 % in may.it was under these conditions that callaghan beat michael foot in a vote to become treasurer of the labour party . the economy was soon in turmoil again by june <days> with the six-day war in the middle east . several arab countries , such as kuwait and iraq , announced an oil embargo against britain , accusing it of intervening on the israeli side in the conflict , resulting in a rise in oil prices which had a disastrous effect on the balance of payments . furthermore , the economy was hit in mid-september when a national dock strike lasted for eight weeks . the final straw , however , was an eec report which suggested that the pound could not be sustained as a reserve currency and it was suggested again that the pound should be devalued . callaghan responded by pointing out that , had it not been for the middle east crisis , britain would have been heading for a balance of payments surplus in <year> . however , rumours that devaluation was on the cards led to heavy selling of sterling on world markets . wilson and callaghan refused a contingency fund offered from the imf because of several conditions attached which they believed would allow the imf to interfere with economic policy . on wednesday <integer> november <days> the historic decision was taken to commit the government to a 14.3 % devaluation from the existing fixed exchange rate of $ 2.80 to the pound , to $ 2.40 to the pound . they intended to announce the decision publicly on the 18th . however , in the run up to the public announcement , callaghan found himself in a tricky situation when answering questions in the house of commons : one backbencher robert sheldon tabled a motion concerning a rumour that britain would be receiving a loan from banks . callaghan did not wish to lie to the commons , but at the same time going public about the devaluation decision before the 18th would be financially disastrous for the country . he answered the initial question by stating that he did not comment on rumours . however a follow up question was made by stan orme suggesting that devaluation was preferable to deflation , which caused a major problem . callaghan replied that he had `` nothing to add or subtract from , anything i have said on previous occasions on the subject of devaluation '' ... speculators seized on the fact that he had not denied there would be a devaluation and started selling sterling . over the next <integer> hours , the flight from sterling cost the country £1,500 million . the situation was a great political controversy at the time . as denis healey in his autobiography notes : nowadays exchange rates can swing to and fro continually by amount greater than that , without attracting much attention outside the city columns of the newspapers . it may <days> difficult to understand how great a political humiliation this devaluation appeared at the time—above all to wilson and his chancellor , jim callaghan , who felt he must resign over it . callaghan 's personal distress was increased by a careless answer he gave to a backbencher 's question two days before the formal devaluation . this cost britain several hundred million pounds . before the devaluation , jim callaghan had announced publicly to the press and the house of commons that he would not devalue , something he later said was necessary to maintain confidence in the pound and avoid creating jitters in the financial markets . callaghan immediately offered his resignation as chancellor , and increasing political opposition forced wilson to accept it . wilson then moved roy jenkins , the home secretary , to be chancellor ; callaghan became the new home secretary on <integer> november <year> . === home secretary , 1967–1970 === callaghan 's tenure as home secretary was marked by the emerging conflict in northern ireland and it was as home secretary that he took the decision to deploy british army troops in the province after a request from the ulster unionist government of northern ireland . callaghan was also responsible for the commonwealth immigrants act <year> , a controversial piece of legislation prompted by conservative assertions that an influx of kenyan asians would soon inundate the country . it passed through the commons in a week and placed entry controls on holders of british passports who had `` no substantial connection '' with britain by setting up a new system . in his memoirs time and chance , callaghan wrote that introducing the commonwealth immigrants bill had been an unwelcome task but that he did not regret it . he said the asians had `` discovered a loophole '' and he told a bbc interviewer : `` public opinion in this country was extremely agitated , and the consideration that was in my mind was how we could preserve a proper sense of order in this country and , at the same time , do justice to these people—i had to balance both considerations '' . an opponent of the act , conservative mp ian gilmour , said that it was `` brought in to keep the blacks out . if it had been the case that it was 5,000 white settlers who were coming in , the newspapers and politicians , callaghan included , who were making all the fuss would have been quite pleased '' .also significant was the passing of the race relations act in the same year , making it illegal to refuse employment , housing or education on the basis of ethnic background . the act extended the powers of the race relations board at the time , to deal with complaints of discrimination and unfair attitudes . it also set up a new supervisory body , the community relations commission , to promote `` harmonious community relations '' . presenting the bill to parliament , callaghan said : `` the house has rarely faced an issue of greater social significance for our country and our children . '' in <year> , callaghan , a strong supporter of the labour–trade union link , led the successful opposition in a divided cabinet to barbara castle 's white paper `` in place of strife '' which sought to modify trade union law . amongst its numerous proposals were plans to force unions to call a ballot before a strike was held and the establishment of an industrial board to enforce settlements in industrial disputes . if the proposals had become law , many of the activities of the trades unions during the winter of discontent a decade later would have been illegal . following wilson 's unexpected defeat by edward heath at the <year> general election , callaghan declined to challenge him for the leadership , despite wilson 's vulnerability . this did much to rehabilitate him in wilson 's eyes . he was in charge of drawing up a new policy statement in <year> which contained the idea of the social contract between the government and trade unions . he also did much to ensure that labour opposed the heath government 's bid to enter the common market—forcing wilson 's hand by making his personal opposition clear without consulting the party leader . === foreign secretary , 1974–1976 === when wilson won the next general election and returned as prime minister <days> march <year> , he appointed callaghan as foreign secretary which gave him responsibility for renegotiating the terms of the united kingdom 's membership of the common market . when the talks concluded , callaghan led the cabinet in declaring the new terms acceptable and he supported a `` yes '' vote in the <year> referendum . he was awarded the freedom of the city of cardiff on <integer> march <year> . ==== <year> leadership election ==== barely two years after beginning his second spell as prime minister , wilson announced his surprise resignation on <integer> march <year> , and unofficially endorsed callaghan as his successor . callaghan was the favourite to win the leadership election ; although he was the oldest candidate , he was also the most experienced and least divisive . popularity with all parts of the labour movement saw him through the ballot of labour mps to win the leadership vote . on <integer> april <year> , at the age of <integer> years and <integer> days , callaghan became prime minister—the oldest prime minister at time of appointment since winston churchill . == prime minister of the united kingdom : 1976–1979 == callaghan was the only prime minister to have held all three leading cabinet positions—chancellor of the exchequer , home secretary and foreign secretary—prior to becoming prime minister . during his first year in office , callaghan started what has since become known as 'the great debate ' , when he spoke at ruskin college , oxford , about the 'legitimate concerns ' of the public about the quality of education in the nation 's maintained schools . this discussion led to greater involvement of the government , through its ministries , in the curriculum and administration of state education , leading to the eventual introduction of the national curriculum some ten years later . early in his premiership he caused controversy with the appointment of peter jay , his then son-in-law as the british ambassador to the united states . callaghan 's time as prime minister was dominated by the troubles in running a government with a minority in the house of commons : he was forced to make deals with minor parties to survive—including the lib–lab pact , and he had been forced to accept a referendum on devolution in scotland as well as one in wales ( the former went in favour but did not reach the required majority , and the latter went heavily against ) . he also became prime minister at a time when britain was suffering from double-digit percentage inflation and rising unemployment . he responded to the economic crises by adopting deflationary policies to reduce inflation , and cutting public expenditure—a precursor to the monetarist economic policies that the next government , a conservative one led by margaret thatcher , would pursue to ease the crises.despite the economic difficulties faced by the government , over the summer of <year> ( shortly after the end of the lib-lab pact ) most opinion polls showed labour ahead , and the expectation grew that callaghan would call an autumn election that would have given him a second term in office until autumn <year> . the economy had also started to show signs of recovery by this time . <year> was a year of economic recovery for britain , with inflation falling to single digits , unemployment declining during the year , and general living standards going up by more than <integer> % . famously , he strung along the opposition and was expected to make his declaration of election in a broadcast on <integer> september <year> . his decision to put off the election was seen by many at the time as a sign of his domination of the political scene and he ridiculed his opponents by singing old-time music hall star vesta victoria 's song `` waiting at the church '' at that month 's trades union congress meeting . this was celebrated at the time but has since been interpreted as one of the greatest moments of hubris in modern british politics . callaghan intended to convey the message that he had not promised an election , but most observers misread his message as an assertion that he would call an election , and the conservatives would not be ready for it . === winter of discontent === callaghan 's method of dealing with the long-term economic difficulties involved pay restraint which had been operating for four years with reasonable success . he gambled that a fifth year would further improve the economy and allow him to be re-elected in <year> , and so attempted to hold pay rises to <integer> % or less . the trade unions rejected continued pay restraint and in a succession of strikes over the winter of 1978–79 ( known as the winter of discontent ) secured higher pay . the industrial unrest made his government extremely unpopular , and callaghan 's response to one interview question only made it worse . returning to the united kingdom from a summit held in guadeloupe <days> january <year> , callaghan was asked , `` what is your general approach , in view of the mounting chaos in the country at the moment ? '' callaghan replied , `` well , that 's a judgement that you are making . i promise you that if you look at it from outside , and perhaps you 're taking rather a parochial view at the moment , i do n't think that other people in the world would share the view that there is mounting chaos . '' this reply was reported in the sun under the headline `` crisis ? what crisis ? '' . callaghan also later admitted in regard to the winter of discontent that he had `` let the country down '' .the winter of discontent saw labour 's performance in the opinion polls slump dramatically . they had topped most of the pre-winter opinion polls by several points , but <days> february <year> at least one opinion poll was showing the tories <integer> points ahead of labour and it appeared certain that labour would lose the forthcoming election.in the buildup to the election , the daily mirror and the guardian supported labour , while the sun , the daily mail , the daily express , and the daily telegraph supported the conservatives . on <integer> march <year> , the house of commons passed a motion of no-confidence by one vote , 311–310 , which forced callaghan to call a general election that was held on <integer> may <days> the conservatives under margaret thatcher ran a campaign on the slogan `` labour is n't working '' and won the election . callaghan agreed to a proposal by brian walden , a former labour mp who was by then a broadcaster , to take part in two televised debates with margaret thatcher to be produced by lwt with the intention that they would be broadcast on itv on <integer> & <integer> april <year> . at the insistence of the liberal party , their leader david steel was also invited to take participate in the prosed debates , and he also quickly accepted the offer . however mrs thatcher ultimately rejected the approach to take part in the debates , citing among other reasons her belief that the election was for a government , not a president . her refusal meant that the debates did not go ahead.callaghan 's failure to call an election during <year> was widely seen as a political miscalculation ; indeed , he himself later admitted that not calling an election was an error of judgement . however , private polling by the labour party in the autumn of <year> had shown the two main parties with about the same level of support . after losing power in <year> , labour spent the next <integer> years in opposition . historians alan sked and chris cook have summarised the general consensus of historians regarding labour in power in the 1970s : if wilson 's record as prime minister was soon felt to have been one of failure , that sense of failure was powerfully reinforced by callaghan 's term as premier . labour , it seemed , was incapable of positive achievements . it was unable to control inflation , unable to control the unions , unable to solve the irish problem , unable to solve the rhodesian question , unable to secure its proposals for welsh and scottish devolution , unable to reach a popular modus vivendi with the common market , unable even to maintain itself in power until it could go to the country and the date of its own choosing . it was little wonder , therefore , that mrs thatcher resoundingly defeated it in <year> . == resignation , backbenches and retirement == notwithstanding electoral defeat , callaghan stayed on as labour leader until <integer> october <year> , shortly after the party conference had voted for a new system of election by electoral college involving the individual members and trade unions . his resignation ensured that his successor would be elected by mps only . following a campaign that laid bare the deep internal divisions of the parliamentary labour party , michael foot narrowly defeated denis healey on <integer> november <days> the second round of the election to succeed callaghan as party leader . foot had been a relatively late entrant to the contest and his decision to stand ended the chances of peter shore . in <year> , along with his friend gerald ford , he co-founded the annual aei world forum.in <year> , he attacked labour 's plans to reduce defence , and the same year became father of the house as the longest continually-serving member of the commons . in <year> , he was made a knight of the garter and stood down at the <year> general election after <integer> years as an mp . he was one of the last remaining mps elected in the labour landslide of <year> . shortly afterwards , he was elevated to the house of lords on <integer> november <year> as a life peer with the title baron callaghan of cardiff , of the city of cardiff in the county of south glamorgan . in <year> , his autobiography , time and chance , was published . he also served as a non-executive director of the bank of wales . his wife audrey , a former chairman ( 1969–82 ) of great ormond street hospital , spotted a letter to a newspaper which pointed out that the copyright of peter pan , which had been assigned by j. m. barrie to the hospital , was going to expire at the end of that year , <year> ( <integer> years after barrie 's death , the then-current copyright term ) . in <year> , callaghan moved an amendment to the copyright designs & patents act , then under consideration in the house of lords , to grant the hospital a right to royalty in perpetuity despite the lapse of copyright , and it was passed by the government . tony benn recorded in his diary entry of <integer> april <year> that during the <year> general election campaign , callaghan was telephoned by a volunteer at labour headquarters asking him if he would be willing to become more active in the party . according to benn : one young woman in her mid-twenties rang up jim callaghan and said to him on the phone , `` have you ever thought of being a bit more active in politics ? '' so callaghan said , `` well i was a labour prime minister – what more could i do ? '' during an interview broadcast on the bbc radio <integer> programme the human button , callaghan became the only prime minister to go on record with his opinion on ordering a retaliation in the event of a nuclear attack on the united kingdom : '' if it were to become necessary or vital , it would have meant the deterrent had failed , because the value of the nuclear weapon is frankly only as a deterrent '' , he said . `` but if we had got to that point , where it was , i felt , necessary to do it , then i would have done it . i 've had terrible doubts , of course , about this . i say to you , if i had lived after having pressed that button , i could never , ever have forgiven myself . '' <days> october <year> , callaghan told the oldie magazine that he would not be surprised to be considered as britain 's worst prime minister in <integer> years . he also said in this interview that he `` must carry the can '' for the winter of discontent . == personal life == callaghan 's interests included rugby ( he played lock for streatham rfc before the second world war ) , tennis and agriculture . he married audrey elizabeth moulton , whom he had met when they both worked as sunday school teachers at the local baptist church , <days> july <year> and had three children—one son and two daughters . margaret , baroness jay of paddington , who married first peter jay and later professor mike adler . julia , who married ian hamilton hubbard and settled in lancashire michael , who married jennifer morris and settled in essex.although there is much doubt about how much belief callaghan retained into adult life , the baptist nonconformist ethic was a profound influence throughout all of his public and private life . like his labour party leader successors michael foot and neil kinnock , callaghan was acknowledged to have been an atheist , and was said to have lost belief in god while he was working as a trade union official.one of his final public appearances came on <integer> april <year> , when shortly after his 90th birthday , he sat alongside the then-prime minister tony blair and three other surviving former prime ministers at the time – edward heath , margaret thatcher and john major at buckingham palace for a dinner which formed part of the celebrations for the golden jubilee of elizabeth ii , alongside his daughter margaret , baroness jay , who had served as leader of the house of lords from <year> until <year> . == death == callaghan died on <integer> march <year> at his home in ringmer , east sussex , of lobar pneumonia , cardiac failure and kidney failure , the day before his 93rd birthday . he died just <integer> days after his wife of <integer> years , who had spent the last four years of her life in a nursing home due to alzheimer 's disease . he died as britain 's longest-lived former prime minister , having surpassed harold macmillan 's record <integer> days earlier.lord callaghan was cremated , and his ashes were scattered in a flowerbed around the base of the peter pan statue near the entrance of london 's great ormond street hospital , where his wife had formerly been chair of the board of governors.his order of the garter banner was transferred from st george 's chapel , windsor castle to llandaff cathedral in cardiff following his death . == historiography == his contribution and legacy are still contested . the left-wing of the labour party considers him a traitor whose betrayals of true socialism laid the foundations for thatcherism . they point to his decision in <year> to allow the imf to control the government budget . they accuse him of abandoning the traditional labour commitment to full employment . they blame his rigorous pursuit of a policy of controlling income growth for the winter of discontent . writers on the right of the labour party complained that he was a weak leader who was unable to stand up to the left . the new labour writers who admire tony blair identify him with the old-style partisanship that was a dead end which a new generation of modernisers had to repudiate.practically all commentators agree that callaghan made a serious mistake by not calling an election in the autumn of <year> . bernard donoughue , a senior official in his government , depicts callaghan as a strong and efficient administrator who stood heads above his predecessor harold wilson . the standard scholarly biography by kenneth o. morgan is generally favourable—at least for the middle of his premiership—while admitting failures at the beginning , at the end and in his leadership role following margaret thatcher 's victory . the treatment found in most textbooks and surveys of the period remains largely negative . == arms == == see also == <year> uk sterling crisis shadow cabinet of james callaghan == references == === bibliography === conroy , harry ( <year> ) .

'' outside academia , tobin was widely known for his suggestion of a tax on foreign exchange transactions , now known as the `` tobin tax '' . this was designed to reduce speculation in the international currency markets , which he saw as dangerous and unproductive . == life and career == === early life === tobin was born on march <days> , <year> , in champaign , illinois . his father was louis michael tobin ( b . <year> ) , a journalist working at the university of illinois at urbana–champaign . his father had fought in world war i , was a member of the first greek organization at illinois ( delta tau delta fraternity beta upsilon chapter ) , and was credited as the inventor of 'homecoming ' . his mother , margaret edgerton tobin ( b . <year> ) , was a social worker . tobin followed primary school at the university laboratory high school of urbana , illinois , a laboratory school in the university 's campus . in <year> , on his father 's advice , tobin took the entrance exams for harvard university . despite no special preparation for the exams , he passed and was admitted with a national scholarship from the university . during his studies he first read keynes ' the general theory of employment , interest and money , published in <year> . tobin graduated summa cum laude in <year> with a thesis centered on a critical analysis of keynes ' mechanism for introducing equilibrium involuntary unemployment . his first published article , in <year> , was based on this senior thesis.tobin immediately started graduate studies , also at harvard , earning his am degree in <year> . in <year> , he interrupted graduate studies to work for the office of price administration and civilian supply and the war production board in washington , d.c . the next year , after the united states entered world war ii , he enlisted in the us navy , spending the war as an officer on a destroyer , including , among possible others , the uss kearny ( <other> ) . at the end of the war he returned to harvard and resumed studies , receiving his ph.d. in <year> with a thesis on the consumption function written under the supervision of joseph schumpeter . in <year> tobin was elected a junior fellow of harvard 's society of fellows , which allowed him the freedom and funding to spend the next three years studying and doing research . === academic activity and consultancy === in <year> tobin moved to yale university , where he remained for the rest of his career . he joined the cowles foundation , which moved to yale in <year> , also serving as its president between 1955–1961 and 1964–1965 . his main research interest was to provide microfoundations to keynesian economics , with a special focus on monetary economics . one of his frequent collaborators was his yale colleague william brainard . in <year> tobin was appointed sterling professor of economics at yale.besides teaching and research , tobin was also strongly involved in the public life , writing on current economic issues and serving as an economic expert and policy consultant . during 1961–62 , he served as a member of john f. kennedy 's council of economic advisors , under the chairman walter heller , then acted as a consultant between 1962–68 . here , in close collaboration with arthur okun , robert solow and kenneth arrow , he helped design the keynesian economic policy implemented by the kennedy administration . tobin also served for several terms as a member of the board of governors of federal reserve system academic consultants and as a consultant of the us treasury department.tobin was awarded the john bates clark medal in <year> and , in <year> , the nobel memorial prize in economics . he was a fellow of several professional associations , holding the position of president of the american economic association in <year> . in <year> tobin , along with fellow yale economics professor william nordhaus , published is growth obsolete ? , an article that introduced the measure of economic welfare as the first model for economic sustainability assessment , and economic sustainability measurement . in 1982–1983 , tobin was ford visiting research professor of economics at the university of california , berkeley . in <year> he formally retired from yale , but continued to deliver some lectures as professor emeritus and continued to write . he died on march <days> , <year> , in new haven , connecticut . tobin was a trustee of economists for peace and security . === personal life === james tobin married elizabeth fay ringo , a former m.i.t . student of paul samuelson , on september <days> , <year> . they had four children : margaret ringo ( born in <year> ) , louis michael ( born in <year> ) , hugh ringo ( born in <year> ) and roger gill ( born in <year> ) . in late june <days> <year> , the family announced via a private email that tobin 's wife had died at the age of <integer> . === legacy === <days> august <year> in a roundtable interview in prospect magazine , adair turner supported the idea of new global taxes on financial transactions , warning that the `` swollen '' financial sector paying excessive salaries had grown too big for society . lord turner 's suggestion that a `` tobin tax '' – named after james tobin – should be considered for financial transactions made headlines around the world . tobin 's tobit model of regression with censored endogenous variables ( tobin 1958a ) is a standard econometric technique . his `` q '' theory of investment ( tobin <year> ) , the baumol–tobin model of the transactions demand for money ( tobin <year> ) , and his model of liquidity preference as behavior toward risk ( the asset demand for money ) ( tobin 1958b ) are all staples of economics textbooks . in his <year> article tobin also led the way in showing how to deal with utility maximization under uncertainty with an infinite number of possible states . as palda explains `` one way to get out of the mess of figuring out asset prices using a model of maximizing the expected utility of investing in stocks is to make assumptions about either preferences or the probabilities of the different possible states of the world . nobellist james tobin ( <year> ) took this line and discovered that in some cases you do not need to worry about the utility of income in thousands of states , and the attached probabilities , to solve the consumer 's choice on how to spread income among states . when preferences contain only a linear and a squared term ( a case of diminishing returns ) or the probabilities of different stock returns follow a normal distribution ( an equation that contains a linear and squared terms as parameters ) , a simple formulation of a person 's investment choices becomes possible . under tobin 's assumptions we can reformulate the person 's decision problem as being one of trading off risk and expected return . risk , or more precisely the variance of your investment portfolio creates spread in the returns you expect . people are willing to assume more risk only if compensated by a higher level of expected return . one can thus think of a tradeoff people are willing to make between risk and expected return . they invest in risky assets to the point at which their willingness to trade off risk and return is equal to the rate at which they able to trade them off . it is difficult to exaggerate how brilliant is the simplification of the investment problem that flows from these assumptions . instead of worrying about the investor 's optimization problem in potentially millions of possible states of the world , one need only worry about how the investor can trade off risk and return in the stock market .
