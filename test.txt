David Lambert Lack FRS (16 July 1910 – 12 March 1973) was a British evolutionary biologist who made contributions to ornithology, ecology, and ethology. His 1947 book, Darwin's Finches, on the finches of the Galapagos Islands was a landmark work as were his other popular science books on Life of the Robin and Swifts in a Tower. He developed what is now known as Lack's Principle which explained the evolution of avian clutch sizes in terms of individual selection as opposed to the competing contemporary idea that they had evolved for the benefit of species (also known as group selection). His pioneering life-history studies of the living bird helped in changing the nature of ornithology from what was then a collection-oriented field. He was a longtime director of the Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology at the University of Oxford.
 
 
 == Education and early life ==
 Lack was born in London, the oldest of four children of Harry Lambert Lack MD FRCS, who later became President of the British Medical Association. The name 'Lack' is derived from 'Lock'. His father grew up in a farming family from Norfolk and became a leading ear, nose and throat surgeon at the London Hospital. Although his father had some interest in birds as a boy it does not appear that he influenced David's interest. His mother Kathleen was the daughter of Lt. Col. McNeil Rind of the Indian army. Kathleen's father was Scottish and on her mother's side was part Irish, Greek and Georgian. Kathleen had been an actor and was a supporter of women's suffrage. At home they organized meetings of the poetry society. David was schooled at home until seven and then went to the Open Air School in Regent's Park before going to The Hall, Hampstead followed by Foster's School, Stubbington and Gresham's School, Holt, Norfolk. Lack was taught biology at Gresham's by W.H. Foy and G.H. Lockett. He went to Magdalene College, Cambridge and received a BA second class in 1933 after studying botany, zoology and geology for part I of the Tripos and zoology for part II.Until the age of fifteen, Lack lived in a large house in Devonshire Place, London. The family spent their summers in New Romney Kent where Lack became familiar with the local birds especially on Romney Marsh. By the age of nine, he had learnt the names of most birds and had written out an alphabetically arranged life-list. In 1926, Lack won the Holland-Martin Natural History Prize for an essay on "Three Birds of Kelling Heath". In 1928, with an essay on 'My favourite birds' he was the national winner of the senior prize (a silver medal) in the Public School Essay Competition, organised by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. David did not wish to follow his father's profession in medicine and took an interest in zoology. His father then considered entomology which was then the only professional field in zoology and found work for David at the Frankfurt museum in the summer of 1929. He spent four months pinning insects in the Senckenberg Museum and found it “extremely” boring. He joined the Cambridge Ornithological Club whose members included Peter Scott, Arthur Duncan, Dominic Serventy, and Tom Harrisson. His first scientific paper was on the display of nightjars, published in the Ibis in 1932. He joined on several expeditions with Cambridge researchers including two to the Arctic. Lack wrote The Birds of Cambridgeshire (1934) which was published by the Cambridge Bird Club. In this work, he departed from the contemporary style with a distinct de-emphasis on rare and accidental birds.Lack received an Sc.D. from Cambridge University in 1948.
 
 
 == Career and research ==
 After Cambridge, Lack, on the recommendation of Julian Huxley took up a position as a science mentor at Dartington Hall School, Devonshire from 1934 until Summer 1938 when he took a year off to study bird behaviour on the Galapagos Islands. In 1935 he made his first trip to the United States as a chaperone for a Dartington Hall student returning to California. Here he met Joseph Grinnell and Robert McCabe and gave a talk at the Cooper Ornithological Club. In New York, he met Ernst Mayr at the American Museum of Natural History. He returned via the SS Bremen, only one of about four English speakers on the German ship. He was only in the Galapagos for part of that year, starting August 1938. With the data that he collected in the Galapagos, especially on the finches he went to the United States. April to August 1939 was spent at the California Academy of Sciences which held a large collection of the finches of Galapagos that had been studied earlier by Harry Swarth and at Ernst Mayr's home in New Jersey. While in the US he made a study of the tricoloured blackbird with John T. Emlen.  He returned home in September 1939, after the outbreak of war. Lack published The Galapagos Finches (Geospizinae), A Study in Variation in which he examined variations within species across islands and considered that many of them were non-adaptive and due to founder effect and genetic drift. Lack's first major work was The Life of the Robin, which was based on four years of field work that he conducted while teaching at Dartington Hall School. He examined robin behaviour, song, territory, pairing and breeding using ringing to mark and track individual birds. The manuscript was completed in 1942 and it went through five editions from 1943 to 1970. One of Lack's students at Dartington Hall was Eva Ibbotson. A colleague who helped in filming some of the robins for Lack was the geography teacher Bill Hunter. In 1934 Lack went to Tanganyika on an invitation from R.E. Moreau.
 
 Lack was committed to pacificism and debated the philosophy even during his Dartington days with the founder of the college, Leonard Knight Elmhirst. During World War II Lack however served with a British Army unit called the Army Operational Research Group on the Orkney Islands working on radar use. During this work he met other biologists who had been inducted into the war including George Varley, an entomologist who introduced him to the idea of density-dependent regulation of animal populations. Lack's observations on spurious echoes produced by birds would later allow him to establish the field of radar ornithology to study bird migration. Lack was released from wartime duty in August 1945 so as to take a position to as Director (succeeding W.B. Alexander) of the Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology at Oxford University, a position that he held until his death in 1973.
 Lack's work in ornithology was almost entirely based on studies of the living bird. He was one of the pioneers of life-history studies in Britain, especially those based on quantitative approaches, when some traditional ornithologists of the time were focussing their studies on morphology and geographic distribution. Lack's major scientific research included work on population biology and density dependent regulation. His work suggested that natural selection favoured clutch sizes that ensured the greatest number of surviving young. This interpretation was however debated by V.C. Wynne-Edwards who suggested that clutch size was density-independent. This was one of the earliest debates on group selection. Lack's studies were based on nidicolous birds and some recent studies have suggested that his findings may not hold for other groups such as seabirds.As a mentor for numerous doctoral students, Lack followed a hands-off method, letting students decide their own research topics. He encouraged students to sort out their ideas and find the "simplest explanation, which was probably best." He would make students work on their papers and give only one reading to their thesis asking them to choose either a draft or a final version to submit.He wrote numerous papers in ornithological journals, and had a knack of choosing memorable titles: he once claimed to have single-handedly caused the renaming of a group of birds through the submission of a scientific paper with the title "Territory and Polygamy in a Bishop". This 1935 publication was subsequently titled "Territory and polygamy in a bishop bird, Euplectes hordeacea hordeacea (Linn.)" in the journal Ibis as the journal editor felt that the title might cause misunderstanding.
 
 
 === Darwin's finches ===
 Lack's most famous work is Darwin's Finches, a landmark study whose title linked Darwin's name with the Galapagos group of species and popularised the term "Darwin's finches" in 1947, though the term had been introduced by Percy Lowe in 1936. There are two versions of this work, differing significantly in their conclusions. The first is a book-length monograph, written after his visit to the Galapagos, but not published until 1945. In it Lack interprets the differences in bill size as species recognition signals, that is, as isolating mechanisms.
 The second is the later book in which the differences in bill size are interpreted as adaptations to specific food niches, an interpretation that has since been abundantly confirmed. This change of mind, according to Lack's Preface, came about as a result of his reflections on his own data whilst he was doing war work. The effect of this change in interpretation is to put the emphasis for speciation onto natural selection for appropriate food handling instead of seeing it primarily as a by-product of an isolating mechanism. In this way his work contributed to the modern evolutionary synthesis, in which natural selection came to be seen as the prime mover in evolution, and not random or mutational events. Lack's work laid the foundations for the much more extensive work of Peter and Rosemary Grant and their colleagues. Lack's work feeds into studies of island biogeography which continue the same range of issues presented by the Galapagos fauna on a more varied canvas. According to Ernst Mayr,
 
 "The person who more than anyone else deserves credit for reviving an interest in the ecological significance of species was David Lack... It is now quite clear that the process of speciation is not completed by the acquisition of isolating mechanisms but requires also the acquisition of adaptations that permit co-existence with potential competitors."
 
 
 === Lack's Principle ===
 In 1943 Lack took an interest in clutch size after reading Moreau's manuscript sent to the Ibis. Lack was then an assistant to the editor of the Ibis. Lack postulated what is now known as Lack's Principle, which states that "the clutch size of each species of bird has been adapted by natural selection to correspond with the largest number of young for which the parents can, on average, provide enough food".
 
 
 === Population regulation ===
 Lack took a keen interest in the mechanisms involved in regulating populations in nature. The Natural Regulation of Animal Numbers is one of Lack's most frequently cited works. Here he gave primacy to natural selection in determining the rate of reproduction and he especially countered the idea that it was adjusted with mortality rates so that constant populations are maintained. It was critiqued by J.B.S. Haldane who found it lacking mathematical precision and biased to bird studies. The other major critic was V.C. Wynne-Edwards with whom he clashed for nearly a decade. Lack followed up on the criticisms in his later books including Population Studies of Birds (1966).

 == Personal life ==
 David Lack married Elizabeth Lack (née Silva) who was also an ornithologist. Elizabeth Silva was born in Hertfordshire in 1916 and took an early interest in music. She wished to joined the Royal Academy of Music in London but the war led to her serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service as an ambulance driver in Europe. After the war she applied for work and due to her interest in birds she sent her resume to Richard Fitter who passed it on to David Lack with a note "Here's another for your reject file." Lack however interviewed her and appointed her as a secretary. Noting her interest in birds, he also invited her to serve as a field assistant for studies in the Wytham Woods. She also helped in the study of swifts. One day Elizabeth did not return to her office after her observations of the swifts and David, worried that she might have fallen off a ladder, found her engrossed in observation. They became engaged in 1948 and were married on July 9, 1949. The best man was George Varley. They had four children: Peter Lack (born 1952, a biologist), Andrew Lack (born 1953, also a biologist and academic), Paul Lack (born 1957, a freelance teacher), and Catherine Lack (born 1959, a university chaplain). In Oxford, the Lacks initially lived in a flat in Park Town, Oxford, and later on Boars Hill, just south of Oxford. Lack enjoyed music and was also a fan of field hockey and tennis in which he also participated. Lack died from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma despite radiation treatments.
 
 
 === Religious beliefs ===
 Lack's parents belonged to the Church of England and he was an agnostic as an early adult but became a convert to Anglicanism in 1948, possibly influenced by Dan and Mary Neylan, friends at Dartington Hall. He sought to find a compromise between science and religion and wrote, in 1957, Evolutionary theory and Christian belief, on the relationship between Christian faith and evolutionary theory. Lack believed that evolution could not account for morality, truth, beauty, free will, self-awareness and individual responsibility. This book foreshadows, in some ways, the non-overlapping magisteria conception of the relationship between religion and science later popularised by Stephen Jay Gould.
 Arthur Cain remarked of him "David Lack was the only religious man I knew at that period who did not allow his religion to dictate his view of natural selection."

Prof. Ord. Sedat Alp (January 1, 1913 in Veroia – October 9, 2006 in Ankara) was the first Turkish archaeologist, historian and academic with a specialization in Hittitology, and was among the foremost names in the field. He was the president of the Turkish Historical Association from 1982 to 1983.
 Sedat Alp was born in Karaferye, present-day Veroia in Greece. His family moved to Turkey as a result of the exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey in 1923. In 1932, he earned a state scholarship opened under the personal auspices of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and was sent to the University of Leipzig (he later transferred to the University of Berlin) to study prehistory, history, Hittitology, Sumerology, Assyriology, ancient Anatolian languages and cultures, as well as archaeology in general. Having earned his doctorate in the University of Berlin, he returned to Turkey in 1940 and started to teach Hittitology within Ankara University's Faculty of Languages, History and Geography (DTCF). He became the dean of the faculty in 1959, continuing at the same time his  work in the field. One of his most notable discoveries was the mound of Maşat Höyük, which in the quantities of Hittite cuneiform tablets was second only to the Hittite capital at Hattusas modern Boğazkale, near Çorum.
 Outside Turkey, Prof. Alp was awarded the Italian Commandatore of the Order of Merit of the Republic in 1957, the Order of Merit of the Presidency of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1972, the French College of France medal in 1980, the German Great Cross of Merit with star and the Grande Ufficiale Order of Merit of the Italian Presidency of the Republic in 1991. From 1997 he held an honorary doctorate at the University of Würzburg, and from the following year was made a member of the British Academy and, for the contributions he made to the promotion of knowledge on the region's historical treasures, an honorary citizen of the city of Çorum in north-central Anatolia, where the Hittite capital was situated. He died in Ankara.

Willem "Wim" Polak (14 September 1924 – 1 October 1999) was a Dutch politician of the Labour Party (PvdA) and economist.Polak was born to a Jewish merchant family in Amsterdam on 14 September 1924. His parents were murdered by the Nazis during the German Occupation of the Netherlands. After the Second World War, he worked as a journalist for Het Vrije Volk. Polak was appointed Secretary of State for local finances in Joop den Uyl's government. He worked towards improving the financial position of the larger Dutch cities. Subsequently, he became mayor of Amsterdam for a six-year period, where his challenges included numerous squatting cases as well as riots related to Queen Beatrix's coronation.
 He died in 1999 at his home in Ilpendam.

George Adelbert "Bart" Bartholomew (June 1, 1919 – October 2, 2006) was an American biologist.  He was born in Independence, Missouri and earned his B.A. and M.A. degrees from the University of California, Berkeley.  During the Second World War he served as a physicist in the U.S. Naval Bureau of Ordnance.  He earned his PhD at Harvard University, but was associated during the rest of his long career, until his retirement in 1989, with the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1981 and a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1985. Bartholomew was the inaugural (1993) recipient of the Cooper Ornithological Society’s Loye and Alden Miller Research Award, which is given in recognition of lifetime achievement in ornithological research.Bartholomew is also recognized for the large number of prolific scientists that trained under his supervision. Specifically, 39 Ph.D. students, 5 postdoctoral researchers, and one Master’s student were trained in his lab at UCLA.  These students went on to train their own students, and as of 2005 his lineage spanned a maximum of seven generations and included nearly 1,200 individuals.  Bartholomew is so well respected among contemporary biologists that it is a source of pride to claim to be in the "Bartholomew Tree", which is to be an academic descendant of Bartholomew.

Fernando da Costa Novaes (April 6, 1927 – March 24, 2004) was a Brazilian ornithologist who worked on the Amazonian bird fauna.
 
 
 == Education ==
 In 1971 he was granted his doctorate from the State University of São Paulo at Rio Claro, with the thesis Estudo ecológico das aves em uma área de vegetação secundária do baixo rio Amazonas, Estado do Pará.
 
 
 == Career ==
 Novaes was based at the Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi, in Belém, where he assembled the second largest bird skin and skeleton collection in Brazil. This collection has been renamed in his honor. His major contributions were in defining the Amazon region's faunal boundaries and affinities, as well as clarifying taxonomic problems.
 In 1954, Novaes was granted a Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation fellowship to study in the US, at the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, of the University of California at Berkeley, with the renowned ornithologist Alden H. Miller.
 Novaes's many publications are listed in the obituaries by Oren and Silva.He is commemorated in the name of the Alagoas foliage-gleaner, Philydor novaesi.

Richard Kenneth Dell  (11 July 1920 – 6 March 2002) was a New Zealand malacologist.
 
 
 == Biography ==
 Dell was born in Auckland in 1920. As a young boy, he took an interest in shells, collecting them from the shores of Waitematā Harbour. He even managed to start a "museum" in his backyard. He also helped curate the Auckland War Memorial Museum shell collection.Dell studied at Mount Albert Grammar School and later at the Auckland University College. He took a teacher’s course at Auckland Teachers' College, but World War II delayed his plans to become a teacher. He joined the New Zealand Artillery, serving on Nissan Island, the Solomon Islands, Southwest Asia, Egypt, and Italy.  He later published several papers on the land snails he had collected in the Solomon Islands.In 1946, he married botanist and schoolteacher Miriam Matthews, and they had four daughters together. His wife continued working after their marriage and became a well-known women's advocate.After the war, Dell was offered a job as malacologist at the Dominion Museum, where he started to standardise the cabinets and built up a collection of more than 30,000 specimens. In the meantime, he took a master's degree in Science at Victoria University College, with a pioneering thesis on cephalopods, octopuses and squid.His breakthrough came with the Chatham Islands Expedition of 1954. The results were published in 1956 as The Archibenthal Mollusca of New Zealand, which was a major contribution to the knowledge of molluscan fauna in the bathyal zone of New Zealand waters. This publication earned him a Doctorate in Science in 1956.Soon after, Dell started to work on Antarctic collections, with among others Alan Beu and Winston Ponder. In 1964, he published a major monograph on the Antarctic bivalves, chitons and scaphopods.Dell became first Assistant Director in 1961 and later in 1966, Director of the Dominion Museum, which would become the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. He retired in 1980, and started writing again. In 1990, he published his standard work Antarctic Mollusca with special reference to the Fauna of the Ross Sea. Dell published more than 150 papers on Mollusca (marine, terrestrial and freshwater), crabs and birds. He also made a major contribution to the Antarctic biogeography.
 
 
 == Honours and awards ==
 In the 1981 New Year Honours, Dell was appointed a Companion of the Queen's Service Order for public services. In 1977, he was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal, and in 1990 he received the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. He was an honoured member of many scientific societies and committees. He won prizes and medals in New Zealand and abroad, including the Hamilton Prize in 1955, and the Hector Medal in 1965, both awarded by the Royal Society of New Zealand. He has named many new species of molluscs and several new crustaceans.
 
 
 == Death ==
 Dell died in 2002, after a long illness, in Wellington. He was survived by his wife, Dame Miriam Dell, and their four daughters.

 Biography and photo 



Władysław Rydzewski (9 July 1911 - 28 August 1980) was a Polish professor of zoology who specialized in ornithology and founded the journal The Ring in 1954.
 Władysław was born in Kraków, the son of geologist Bronisław Rydzewski and Maria. After studying at the Warsaw Gymnasium he went to study at the University of Warsaw under Professor Konstanty Janicki (1876-1932) and Jan Tur. He joined the Nature Conservation League in 1930. In 1933 he joined military service and went to the Artillery Reserve Officer School in Volhynia. In 1937 he submitted his master's thesis and then visited ornithological research stations at Rēzekne, Riga and Tartu. From 1938 he edited the newsletter of the bird research station of the State Museum of Zoology but was interrupted by World War II. He joined the 3rd Light Artillery Regiment in August 1939 and found during the September campaign during which he was wounded and briefly held prisoner. In 1940 he was in charge of the Zoological Museum but he also took part in the underground resistance under the nickname of "Bogdan" and "Niemen". He was fired from his work and during the Warsaw Uprising he served as commander of the 1st Platoon 6 battalion Zaremba-Piorun of the Home Army. He was wounded and later awarded the Cross of the Order of the Virtuti Militari.
 After the war, he joined the Polish army but was sent to Italy as he had a lung infection. He was later posted in Egypt and Lebanon. In 1947 he moved to the United Kingdom and for two years he served as a volunteer in the ornithology department of the British Museum. He worked in Croydon at a plastic factory and later a radio engineering company. He also studied at the Imperial College in London and wrote a dissertation on "The nomadic movements and migrations of the European Common Heron, Ardea cinerea L." for which he received a Ph.D. in 1954. He attended the ornithological congress at Uppsala in 1951, presenting a history of bird ringing. In 1954 he presented on "The History of Birdwatching". In 1959 he became a lecturer and spent about five month in the Canary Islands studying migration with American ornithologists. He was offered a professorship in the United States but he refused it in favour of an invitation from Poland and returned there in December 1960. He became an associate professor at the University of Wroclaw and later became a head of the department of comparative zoology. He then established an ornithology department and headed it until 1969. In 1963 he organized the EURING, a collaboration of European ornithologists studying bird migration.Rydzewski founded and edited The Ring in 1954, publishing it from Croydon for the first six years and then from Wroclaw until his death in 1980. He also served as editor (1962-1973) of Acta Ornithologica published by the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw.

David Boris Pall (2 April 1914 – 21 September 2004), founder of Pall Corporation, was the chemist who invented the Pall filter used in blood transfusions.
 
 
 == Education ==
 Born in 1914 in Thunder Bay, Ontario of Russian immigrant parents, he grew up on a farm in Saskatchewan. He attended McGill University, from which he was granted a bachelor's degree in chemistry and a Ph.D. in physical chemistry.
 
 
 == Career ==
 He moved to New York City in 1938 and became a part of the Manhattan Project. Pall worked on the design a filter to separate uranium 235 from uranium 238 using sintered stainless steel mesh.In 1946, he established Pall Corporation.  The company's initial focus was on the development of filters for use in aircraft hydraulics.  However, in 1959, when  Dr. Pall's first wife, Josephine, died of aplastic anemia, he began to work on the Pall filter. Mrs. Pall had undergone multiple blood transfusions in the course of an illness, which were ultimately unsuccessful. His Pall filter was designed to make blood transfusions significantly safer by filtering out white blood cells, thereby reducing the incidence of transfusion reactions and viral infections.
 Pall expanded the business, adding additional products. Today, Pall Corporation has sales in excess of $2.0 Billion.
 
 
 == Achievements ==
 In his lifetime, Dr. Pall received over 180 patents and in 1990, he received the United States National Medal of Technology from President George H.W. Bush.Pall was a trustee of the North Shore University Hospital.
 
 
 == Death and legacy ==
 Pall died of complications of Alzheimer's disease at his last home in Roslyn Estates, New York.
 Pall's grandson is music producer Alex Pall of The Chainsmokers.

Victor Zarnowitz (born 1919 in Oświęcim Poland, d. 21 February 2009 in New York City) was a leading scholar on business cycles, indicators, and forecast evaluation.  Zarnowitz was Senior Fellow and Economic Counselor to The Conference Board. He was Professor Emeritus of Economics and Finance, Graduate School of Business, The University of Chicago, and Research Associate, National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER).
 In 1939, he fled Poland to escape the Nazi invasion, but was imprisoned by the Soviet Russians and worked at a labor camp in Siberia.  Zarnowitz earned his Ph.D. in economics (summa cum laude) at the University of Heidelberg in Germany in 1951.  He came to the United States in 1952.  In 1959 he moved to Chicago and became a professor at the University of Chicago.He was a Fellow of the National Association of Business Economists, Fellow of the American Statistical Association, Honorary Fellow of the International Institute of Forecasters, and Honorary Member of the Center for International Research on Economic Tendency Surveys (CIRET). In 2001, he received the William F. Butler Memorial Award from the New York Association for Business Economists. His numerous papers and books include An Appraisal of Short-Term Economic Forecasts (1967), The Business Cycle Today (1972), Orders, Production, and Investment (1973), and Business Cycles: Theory, History, Indicators, and Forecasting (1992). His most recent papers are "Has the Business Cycle Been Abolished?" (1998), "Theory and History Behind Business Cycles" (1999), and "The Old and the New in U.S. Economic Expansion" (2000).
 He was notable as a researcher on the performance of economic forecasting, and he concluded that economic forecasters have little success in predicting business cycle turning points.  He established that planners are better off using the average of forecasts, rather than relying on any individual forecast.  This has become a common practice on the part of governments in the setting of their budgets.
 Zarnowitz remained an active economist throughout his life.  In 1999 he joined The Conference Board, the organization which publishes the Index of Leading Indicators and the Consumer Confidence Index.  He continued working five-day weeks until the day before he died, according to The Conference Board, and he was also an active member of the Business Cycle Dating Committee at the National Bureau of Economic Research.  His final decision with the committee was the determination that the Late-2000s recession had begun in December 2007. In 2008, Zarnowitz published a book about his experiences with Nazis and Russians, "Fleeing the Nazis, Surviving the Gulag, and Arriving in the Free World: My Life and Times," which received wide praise.The historical pattern in which deep recessions are usually followed by steep recoveries is known by economists as "the Zarnowitz rule".

Sidney Michael Dancoff (September 27, 1913 in Philadelphia – August 15, 1951 in Urbana, Illinois) was an American theoretical physicist best known for the Tamm–Dancoff approximation method and for nearly developing a renormalization method for solving quantum electrodynamics (QED).
 Dancoff was raised in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh.  He attended Carnegie Tech on a private scholarship and received his B.S. in physics in 1934, followed by a master's degree from the University of Pittsburgh in 1936. He then went to the University of California at Berkeley where he earned his PhD in 1939 under Robert Oppenheimer.While Dancoff was at Berkeley, Oppenheimer suggested  that he work on the calculation of the scattering of a relativistic electron by an electric field.  Such QED calculations typically gave infinite answers.  Following earlier perturbation-theory work by Oppenheimer and Felix Bloch, he found that he could deal in various ways with the infinities that arose, sometimes by canceling a positive infinity with a negative one.  However, some infinities remained uncanceled and the method (later called renormalization) did not give finite results.  He published a general description of this work in 1939.In 1948, Sin-Itiro Tomonaga and his students revisited this paper.  Using improved calculational methods, they found that Dancoff had omitted one term or two terms.  Once they repaired this omission, Dancoff's method worked, and they built on it to produce a theory of QED, for which Tomonaga shared the Nobel Prize in 1965.  (At the same time, American physicists discovered Dancoff's error and solved QED, relying less directly on Dancoff.)During the Second World War, Dancoff worked on the theory of the newly invented nuclear reactors.  To take into account how fuel rods could "shadow" other rods by absorbing neutrons headed toward the other rods, he and M. Ginsburg developed the Dancoff factor, still used in reactor calculations.After the war, Dancoff was on the faculty of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  In 1950 he published an approximation method for many-body theory that has been used in nuclear and solid-state physics.  Igor Tamm had found it in 1945, and the method is now named after both.
 In the late 1940s, Dancoff began a collaboration with the Viennese-refugee physician and radiologist Henry Quastler in the new field of cybernetics and information theory.  Their work led to the publication of what is now commonly called Dancoff's Law.  A non-mathematical statement of this law is, "the greatest growth occurs when the greatest number of mistakes are made consistent with survival".Dancoff died of lymphoma in 1951.

Robert Bryce (born 1960) is an American author and journalist in Austin, Texas. His articles on energy, politics, and other topics have appeared in numerous publications, including the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Real Clear Energy, Counterpunch, and National Review.
 
 
 == Career ==
 Bryce has been writing about the energy business for three decades. He spent twelve years writing for The Austin Chronicle. From 2006 to 2010, he was the managing editor of the online magazine, Energy Tribune. From October 2007 to February 2008 he was a fellow at the Institute for Energy Research. From 2010 to 2019 he was a Senior Fellow at the Manhattan Institute.

 === Writing on the Energy Industry and Species Protection ===
 Bryce has written frequently about the in-feasibility of the United States becoming energy independent.In March 2009, he testified before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources to discuss the limits inherent in renewable energy, saying "no matter how you do the calculations, renewable energy by itself, can not, will not, be able to replace hydrocarbons over the next two to three decades, and that's a conservative estimate".In an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal in March 2009 he denounced the energy policies of former United States President George W. Bush and the current president Barack Obama, claiming their rush for renewable energy will not be sufficient to cover the country's future energy needs.Bryce has criticized special exceptions to wildlife protection laws given to renewable energy facilities in the United States. Oil producers and electric utilities have repeatedly been charged and fined under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act for killing birds; meanwhile, wind-power companies are not prosecuted despite routine violations of the MBTA. In the Wall Street Journal, he wrote,
 
 Yet there is one group of energy producers that are not being prosecuted for killing birds: wind-power companies. And wind-powered turbines are killing a vast number of birds every year. A July 2008 study of the wind farm at Altamont Pass California, estimated that its turbines kill an average of 80 golden eagles per year. The study, funded by the Alameda County Community Development Agency, also estimated that about 10,000 birds—nearly all protected by the migratory bird act—are being whacked every year at Altamont.
 He also wrote about the health problems caused by low-frequency noise emitted from wind turbines.In June 2010, in an article for Slate he expressed dismay at the corn ethanol industry's attempts to use the blowout of the Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico as an basis to pursue more subsidies.Bryce is an advocate for increased shale gas consumption in the US. In a June 13, 2011 piece published in the Wall Street Journal he posited that the "shale revolution now underway is the best news for North American energy since the discovery of the East Texas Field in 1930."Bryce opposes federal corn subsidies for ethanol, citing high costs.He has argued that electric vehicles have failed to date due to the lack of energy density in batteries, safety concerns, and relatively few sales.

 Bryce recently argued that renewable energy remains unready to meet real-world energy needs at a scale that can save the climate.Accordingly, he has long favored "N2N" (natural gas to nuclear), as the logical way forward for energy policy and insurance against the potential risk of climate change.
 
 
 ==== Carbon Capture and Sequestration ====
 In May 2010, he published an op-ed in The New York Times that underscored the difficulties associated with large-scale carbon capture and sequestration. He has recently extended this line of argument in National Review Online
 
 
 === Writings on Politics and Current Events ===
 
 
 ==== George W. Bush ====
 In 1993, Bryce wrote a piece for the Christian Science Monitor about George W. Bush's jump into the Texas gubernatorial race arguing that Bush would "pose a formidable challenge" to then Democratic Governor Ann Richards.  Bryce also referred to Karl Rove a "savvy political consultant."Bryce predicted that Bush would win the White House in a 1999 piece for The Austin Chronicle, and was the first journalist to report on how Bush's ownership of the Texas Rangers would become a financial asset.
 Bryce also analyzed how Bush and his partners used the power of eminent domain to profit off of land they did not own.
 
 
 ==== "I am Sullied-No More" ====
 In 2007, Bryce featured 44-year-old Colonel Theodore S. Westhusing's suicide note in an article for the Texas Observer titled, "I am Sullied-No More." In it he argues that Westhusing chose death over dishonor while faced with the Iraq war's corruption.
 
 
 ==== Funeral industry ====
 In 1999, Bryce wrote about corruption in the funeral industry, reporting on how Robert Waltrip, C.E.O of the world's largest death-care company, Service Corporation International "used the [Texas] governor's office and a state senator in an effort to crush an investigation into S.C.I.'s operations."
 
 
 ==== V-22 Tiltrotor ====
 Bryce has been an outspoken critic of the troubled V-22 tiltrotor, or Osprey, for its safety and cost record.
 
 
 == Controversy ==
 In October 2011 a petition was addressed to The New York Times complaining about Bryce. It asked the paper's public editor, Arthur Brisbane, to address the issue of how op-ed writers are identified and asked that the paper be more transparent with regard to any financial support the op-ed writers may get from various industries.
 On October 29, 2011, Brisbane responding to the petition, writing "I don't think Mr. Bryce is masquerading as anything: experts generally have a point of view". Regarding the issue of funding from energy-related interests, Brisbane wrote that "the Manhattan Institute's dependence on this category of funding is slight – about 2.5 percent of its budget over the past 10 years."In June 2013, TheAutoChannel.com published a 60-page rebuttal of Robert Bryce's "Gusher of Lies" written by Marc J. Rauch, co-founder of The Auto Channel. The rebuttal challenges Mr. Bryce's negative claims about ethanol. Mr. Bryce has not responded to Rauch's criticisms.

Kelvin John Lancaster (10 December 1924 – 23 July 1999) was an Australian mathematical economist and John Bates Clark professor of economics at Columbia University. He is best known for the development of the Theory of the Second Best with Richard Lipsey. Lancaster was also active in developing the calculus of qualitative economics, formulating the household production function, and applying the hedonic model to the estimation of housing prices.
 In a 1966 paper, Lancaster developed what he called a "new theory of consumer demand", in which the then standard microeconomic demand theory was modified by stipulating that what consumers are seeking to acquire is not goods themselves (e.g. cars or train journeys) but the characteristics they contain (e.g. transport from A to B, display of fashion sense). As Palda (2013) explains
 The second evolution in spatial economics was due to Kelvin Lancaster. His insight was that the basic qualities that consumers seek could be manipulated by combining different products. Hotelling had not considered this possibility. He had been content to accept that one good provided one underlying feature that could be measured in characteristics space. Lancaster saw the matter in greater breadth. Dinner was not just food on a table. It was an attempt to manipulate the basic constituents of flavor and nutrition into a satisfying gastronomic experience. Being a good cook meant knowing that taste had several dimensions including sweet, salty, sour, and savory. For a meal to be agreeable, it had to combine these elements of flavor and it also had to be easily digested, suggesting that nutritional dimensions such as greasiness, protein content, and temperature had to figure into the cook’s understanding. These basic culinary entities could each be thought of as lying on a left-right scale, or space. The ideal meal, then, sought to combine these features by varying each one as precisely as possible.
 This theory provides a convenient account of the difference between less developed (so called "primitive") consumption economies, in which there are fewer goods than characteristics, and more developed ("sophisticated") consumption economies, in which there are more goods than characteristics, so that consumers can secure any combination of characteristics they desire, subject only to budget constraints. It also provides a way of predicting demand for new commodities, so long as they do not embody any new characteristics.According to economist Jagdish Bhagwati, "He was widely regarded as a potential recipient of the Nobel Prize, for the notable impact that had been made by his contributions to the theory of second best and the integration of variety into economic theory. He joins the list of extraordinary economists such as Joan Robinson, Roy Harrod, and Mancur Olson whom death deprived of this singular honor."Lancaster attended Sydney Boys High School, graduating in 1940.

Henry William Frederick Saggs (2 December 1920 – 31 August 2005) was an English classicist and orientalist.
 
 
 == Early life and education ==
 Saggs was born in East Anglia on 2 December 1920. He attended Clacton County High School, following which he went to King's College London where he studied theology, graduating in 1942.Saggs fought in the Second World War with the Fleet Air Arm. He suffered a broken back following an air accident in 1944. His brother, Arthur Roy Saggs, a sergeant in the RAF, died on 4 January 1945 in South Africa on a training flight, aged 20.
 In 1946, he married his wife Joan Butterworth. They had four daughters.He began his Assyriological studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London, under Sidney Smith after the war. In 1952, he joined Max Mallowan's excavation at Nimrud under the aegis of the British School of Archaeology in Iraq.Saggs was awarded his PhD degree in 1953 for his dissertation titled A study of city administration in Assyria and Babylonia in the period 705 to 539 B.C. He joined SOAS as a lecturer in Akkadian.
 
 
 == Career ==
 Saggs has been described as "one of the outstanding Assyriologists of his generation". His life's work, encouraged by Max Mallowan, was the publication of 243 letters found at the Nimrud archive of cuneiform tablets. These were released as a series of articles in the journal Iraq and the book The Nimrud Letters 1952 (Cuneiform Texts from Nimrud V).In 1965, Saggs worked at Tell al-Rimah in northern Iraq, and published a business archive of tablets dating from Middle Assyrian.In 1966, Saggs was invited to take the Chair of Semitic Languages in University College, Cardiff. He served as Professor there from 1966 to 1983. Here he established good relations with Iraq's universities, inviting and training a series of Iraqi Assyriologists who then became influential in their own country. He also expanded Cardiff's specialisations to Ugaritic and Aramaic studies.Saggs taught at Baghdad University in 1956-57, and later at Mosul University. He published the Anzu tablet of Sherifkhan with his former student Amir Suleiman, who was head of the department of arts at Mosul.
 
 
 == Later life ==
 Following his retirement, Saggs remained active both academically and in his pursuit of Old Testament studies, becoming a lay reader at Roydon, near Harlow. He published works popularising Assyriology and the history of the ancient Near East.Saggs died on 31 August 2005.

Lloyd Appleton Metzler (1913 – 26 October 1980) was an American economist best known for his contributions to international trade theory.  He was born in Lost Springs, Kansas in 1913.  Although most of his career was spent at the University of Chicago, he was not a member of the Chicago school, but rather a Keynesian. 
 Lloyd was the youngest of three sons of Leroy and Lulu Appleton Metzler, who were both schoolteachers and both had college degrees. All three of the boys attended the University of Kansas at Lawrence. Leroy was a civil engineer, and Donald became the head of the engineering department and served as mayor of Lawrence. Lloyd was heading for a degree and career in business until he fell under the tutelage of John Ise, who convinced him to switch to economics, and who was a lifelong hero.After graduation, Metzler received his PhD in Economics at Harvard University, where he became great friends with Paul Samuelson.
 Metzler worked post-World War II with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) in Washington DC, and spent much of that time working on post-war reconstruction in Europe.
 Metzler was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1942 upon completing his PhD at Harvard.  He was made a Distinguished Fellow of the American Economic Association in 1968.
 In the early 1950s Metzler's career was severely impacted by the discovery of a brain tumor, and several surgeries. He continued to teach for another 20 years at the University of Chicago.
 The Metzler paradox as well as Metzler matrices bear his name.

Giorgio Perlasca (13 January 1910, in Como – 15 August 1992, in Padua) was an Italian businessman and former fascist who, with the collaboration of official diplomats, posed as the Spanish consul-general to Hungary in the winter of 1944, and saved 5,218 Jews from deportation to Nazi extermination camps in eastern Europe. In 1989 Perlasca was designated by Israel as a Righteous Among the Nations.
 
 
 == Early life ==
 Giorgio Perlasca was born in Como and grew up in Maserà, province of Padua, Italy. During the 1920s, he became a supporter of Fascism, fighting in East Africa during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, and in the Spanish Civil War for the Nationalist Corpo Truppe Volontarie.  As a gratitude safe conduct for his service in Spain, he was awarded a diplomatic mission from Francisco Franco.
 Perlasca grew disillusioned with fascism, in particular due to Benito Mussolini's alliance with Nazism and adoption of Italian racial laws that came into force in 1938.
 
 
 == In World War II ==
 During the initial phase of World War II, he worked at procuring supplies for the Italian Army in the Balkans. He was later appointed as an official delegate of the Italian government with diplomatic status and sent to Eastern Europe with the mission of buying meat for the Italian army fighting on the Russian front. On 8 September 1943, Italy surrendered to the Allies. Italians had to choose whether to join Benito Mussolini's newly formed Italian Social Republic, which was fascist, or stay loyal to the King and join the Allied side. Perlasca chose the latter.
 In Budapest, he was arrested and confined to a castle reserved for diplomats. After a few months, he used a medical pass that allowed him to travel within Hungary and he requested political asylum at the Spanish Embassy. He took advantage of his status as a veteran of the Spanish war. He adopted the first name of "Jorge" and, since Spain was neutral in the war, he became a free man.Perlasca worked with the Spanish Chargé d'Affaires, Ángel Sanz Briz, and other diplomats of neutral states to smuggle Jews out of Hungary. The system he devised consisted of furnishing "protection cards" which placed Jews under the guardianship of various neutral states. He helped Jews find refuge in protected houses under the control of various embassies, which had extraterritorial conventions that gave them an equivalent to sovereignty. They could provide asylum for Jews.When Sanz Briz was transferred from Hungary to Switzerland in November 1944, he invited Perlasca to accompany him to safety. However, Perlasca chose to remain in Hungary. The Hungarian government ordered the Spanish Embassy building and the extraterritorial houses where the Jews took refuge to be cleared out. Perlasca immediately made the false announcement that Sanz Briz was due to return from a short leave, and that he had been appointed his deputy for the meantime. Throughout the winter, Perlasca was active in hiding, shielding and feeding thousands of Jews in Budapest. He continued issuing safe conduct passes (initiated by Sanz Briz), on the basis of a Spanish law passed in 1924 that granted citizenship to Jews of Sephardic origin (descendants of Iberian Jews expelled from Spain in the late 15th century).In December 1944, Perlasca rescued two boys from being herded onto a freight train in defiance of a German lieutenant colonel on the scene. The Swedish diplomat-rescuer Raoul Wallenberg, also present there, later told Perlasca that the officer who had challenged him was Adolf Eichmann. Over 45 days, from 1 December 1944 to 16 January 1945, Perlasca helped save more than 5,000 Jews, about four times more than those saved by Oskar Schindler.According to Perlasca, he also prevented the execution of a plan to demolish the Budapest Ghetto with around 60,000 people in it, as the Nazis had done in Warsaw. While Perlasca was posing as the Spanish consul-general, he learned of the intentions of the SS and the far-right Hungarian Arrow Cross to destroy the ghetto. Shocked and incredulous, he asked for a direct hearing with the Hungarian interior minister, Gábor Vajna, and threatened him with legal and economic measures against the "3,000 Hungarian citizens" (in fact, a much smaller number) declared by Perlasca as residents of Spain, unless he withdrew the plan. Perlasca also offered to help Vajna and his family escape from Hungary before the advancing Soviet Army reached Budapest. The plan to raze the Budapest Ghetto was subsequently cancelled.
 
 
 == After the war ==
 After the war, Perlasca returned to Italy. He did not talk about his actions in Hungary to anyone, including his family, and lived a quiet life. In 1987, a group of Hungarian Jews whom he had saved finally found him after searching for him for 42 years in Spain. There was publicity at the time, and Perlasca became noted for his heroic deeds. Enrico Deaglio wrote an account of his remarkable heroism, Banality of Goodness, (2002), which became a bestseller. The book was adapted as a made-for-TV film, Perlasca – Un eroe Italiano (2005), by the RAI national television corporation, not to be confused with the 1993 movie Perlasca.
 Giorgio Perlasca died of a heart attack in 1992.
 
 
 == Decorations and honors ==
 
 In 1987 Perlasca was made an honorary citizen of Israel and was honored by the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial Museum with a stele and a 10,000 tree forest.
 Perlasca was designated by Israel as a Righteous Among the Nations in 1989 for his efforts

Thomas Klestil (German pronunciation: [ˈtoːmas ˈklɛstɪl] (listen); 4 November 1932 – 6 July 2004) was an Austrian diplomat and politician who served as President of Austria from 1992 to his death in 2004. He was elected in 1992 and re-elected into office in 1998.
 
 
 == Biography until 1992 ==
 Born in Vienna to a working class family — his father was a tramway employee — Klestil went to school in Landstraße where he made friends with Joe Zawinul. He studied at the Vienna University of Economics and Business Administration and received his doctorate in 1957. After entering the civil service he worked in Austria as well as abroad, e.g. for OECD. In 1969, he established the Austrian consulate-general in Los Angeles, where he befriended Arnold Schwarzenegger. Fluent in English, Klestil was the Austrian ambassador to the United Nations (1978–1982) and Ambassador to the United States (1982–1987) prior to his election as president.
 
 
 == Presidency ==
 After being nominated by the conservative Austrian People's Party to run for Federal President, he succeeded Kurt Waldheim on 8 July 1992. However, in the course of his two terms of office, Klestil's alienation from his own party became increasingly obvious, so much so that there was open antagonism between Federal Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel and Klestil when, in 2000, the latter had to swear in the newly formed coalition government with Jörg Haider's Austrian Freedom Party. Klestil, who during his election campaign had vowed to be an "active" president, repeatedly criticized the Austrian government and, in an interview with a Swiss daily given in 2003, stated that, theoretically speaking, it was in his power to dismiss the government any time he found it necessary to do so. As a matter of fact, the Austrian constitution gives far-reaching powers to the federal president, but these had never been exercised by any of Klestil's predecessors.
 
 
 === Support of Kiryat Mattersdorf ===
 Klestil gave his support to the development of Kiryat Mattersdorf, a Haredi Jewish neighborhood in northern Jerusalem founded by the Mattersdorfer Rav, Rabbi Shmuel Ehrenfeld, in 1959 in memory of the Siebengemeinden (Seven Communities) of Burgenland that were destroyed in the Holocaust, Mattersdorf being one of them. Ehrenfeld's son, Rabbi Akiva Ehrenfeld, who served as president of the neighborhood, established close ties with the Austrian government to obtain funding for several institutions, including a kindergarten and the Neveh Simcha nursing home. Following Klestil's official state visit to Israel in 1994, which included a side tour of Kiryat Mattersdorf, Klestil hosted Ehrenfeld at an official reception at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna on 24 January 1995.
 
 
 == Personal ==
 Klestil met his future wife Edith Wielander (1932–2011) at the age of 17 in 1949. The marriage took place in 1957 and until the election as Austrian president in 1992, the couple had three children together. The couple separated in 1994, when Klestil made public that he had a love affair with diplomat Margot Löffler. The couple divorced in September 1998, and Klestil married Löffler three months later. When Klestil died in 2004, Edith attended the funeral service.
 Klestil suffered from health issues related to his lungs, including a serious illness in 1996.
 
 
 == Death and burial ==
  
 On 5 July 2004, three days before he was to leave office, he suffered a heart attack or heart failure, probably caused by his long-term lung problems, and was left in critical condition. He died on 6 July at 23:33 local time at the AKH (Allgemeines Krankenhaus – General Hospital) in Vienna from multiple organ failure.On 10 July 2004, the funeral service was held in St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna, and he was interred in the presidential crypt at Vienna's Central Cemetery (Zentralfriedhof). Among the notable dignitaries who attended his funeral were Russian president Vladimir Putin, former Austrian president and UN secretary-general Kurt Waldheim, and Austrian-born Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger. Klestil was the fifth president of Austria to die in office since 1950.

 Biography, time table & speeches in German 



Richard Patrick Goodwin (26 February 1920 – 14 May 2008), known as Derek Goodwin, was a British ornithologist who wrote a series of what The Times called "definitive works" on estrildid finches, crows and pigeons. He was considered to be an expert on bird behaviour.Goodwin was born Richard Patrick Goodwin in Woking, United Kingdom, on 26 February 1920. His parents called him Derek for reasons he never fully understood, but the name stayed with him for his entire life. He served in the British military in the Royal Artillery during World War II and was a veteran of the Siege of Tobruk. He left the military in August 1945 and embarked on his career in ornithology.Goodwin was a writer and contributor to Avicultural Magazine. By chance, in July 1945, while Goodwin was still in active duty in the military, his purchase of back issues of Avicultural Magazine led to a series of unexpected events which led to his employment at the Natural History Museum. Though he had no formal education in ornithology at the time, Goodwin was hired to work in the Natural History Museum's bird room. He eventually rose up through the ranks to become principal scientific officer for birds at the museum.  In 1965 he participated in the third of the Harold Hall Australian ornithological collecting expeditions.  He wrote a series of detailed books on crows, pigeons and estrildid finches during the 1970s and 1980s as part of his work at the British Museum. These works are still regarded as the definitive works on these particular birds today.  He also authored and published his favorite work, Birds in Man’s World, and wrote a series of children's books and pamphlets on birds.He was known as a prolific bird correspondents and was elected as a corresponding member of Deutsche Ornithologen-Gesellschaft in the 1970s, though he never studied German in school. He also taught and mentored noted ornithologists, such as Aubrey Manning, Rob Hume and Desmond Morris when they were students.Goodwin was also a longtime advocate for the plight of two rare pheasant species; the golden pheasant and the Lady Amherst's pheasant. He wrote numerous letters and articles on the subject of these two birds.  He even resigned from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds to protest its perceived lack of support for saving these pheasants, which had been introduced to parts of rural England. Unlike most ornithologists and bird watchers, Goodwin supported the plight of introduced  bird species in Britain and elsewhere. However, he did not support the reintroduction of raptor species, even regarding the white-tailed eagle as a potential danger to other species.Derek Goodwin died on 14 May 2008, at the age of 88.

William S. Hoar,  (August 31, 1913, Moncton NB – June 13, 2006, Vancouver BC) was a professor and head of department of zoology at the University of British Columbia.  He received an Order of Canada award on June 26, 1974.  He also had several other degrees and diplomas, some of which were honorary (LLD from SFU in 1998), and others of which were earned the old-fashioned hard-work way (DSc).  He was, first and foremost, a grandfather, husband and father.  A patient man who was very involved with his family, he was also very well known in the zoology world, and has a series of lectures named after him, that are given every year at UBC. Anyone desiring to make a donation to continue funding these perpetual lectures can do so here: click to donate.
 Bill, as he was known, is survived by 3 children, 7 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren (7 of whom were already born at the time of his death).  His 4th biological child died before he died.  His surviving children are Stewart George, David Innes, and Melanie Frances.
 Dr. Hoar married on August 13, 1941.  His wife was Margaret (Myra) MacRae MacKenzie from Scotland.  Bill and Myra jointly wrote "A Hebridean Heritage" on Myra's family ancestry.  Prior to that, Bill had already written other books on his family history, including "By Way of New England" and "Steeves and Colpitts:  Pioneers of the Upper Petitcodiac".  His passion was for genealogy when he retired, but having had prior success as a well published zoology professor, he knew his way around book writing and editing.  His "baby" from the zoology years was General and Comparative Physiology [1].  His later family history books were written on his own company's press, called "Tangled Roots Press".
 Long before having children, Bill worked with Charles Best, co-discoverer of insulin.  Bill met his wife Myra in an elevator one day, carrying rabbits in his hand for animal testing.  It was not love at first sight; they became friends first, and when he eventually proposed to her, she answered that she "would have to think about it" rather than an absolute yes or no.  However, evidently she ultimately agreed and they settled down to married life.  They were married 50+ years when Myra died, a long and happy marriage.
 Bill suffered from poliomyelitis as a boy, which left him with a smaller withered leg.  He was a proud man and never fussed over his minor handicap.  Ultimately he also was affected by post-polio syndrome much later in life.
 In the later years of his life Hoar enjoyed sushi lunches, and lunches out with his old boys' club from his university faculty days.  He was a very well read and well educated man who continued to read long non-fiction books into his 90s.  His ultimate demise was mostly age-related.

Béla Alexander Balassa (6 April 1928 – 10 May 1991) was a Hungarian economist and professor at Johns Hopkins University and a consultant for the World Bank.
 Balassa is best known for his work on the relationship between purchasing power parity and cross-country productivity differences (the Balassa–Samuelson effect).
 He is also known for his work on revealed comparative advantage.Balassa received a law degree from the University of Budapest. He left Hungary after the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and went to Austria. While there, he received a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to study at Yale University, where he received M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in economics in 1958 and 1959, respectively.  He won the John Addison Porter Prize for 1959.  Balassa also did extensive consulting work for the World Bank, serving as an advisor about development and trade policy.  According to an authoritative history of the Bank, Balassa was "a protagonist of the Bank's conceptual transformation in the trade-policy area during the 1970s."Beyond economics, Balassa was a noted gourmet who compiled and periodically updated an unofficial guide to eating well in Paris while remaining within an international agency expense allowance, which circulated among his friends and colleagues.

Karl August Fritz Schiller (24 April 1911 – 26 December 1994) was a German economist and politician of the Social Democratic Party (SPD). From 1966 to 1972, he was Federal Minister of Economic Affairs and from 1971 to 1972 Federal Minister of Finance. He was the inventor of the magic square, depicting Economic equilibrium, and of the Concerted activity (Konzertierte Aktion) to reflate the German market. He is thus seen as one of the most influential German economists beside Ludwig Erhard.
 
 
 == Education and career ==
 Schiller was born in Breslau. From 1931, after passing the Abitur, he studied economics and law at Kiel, Frankfurt, Berlin and Heidelberg. In 1935, he finished his studies and got his doctorate in politics. From 1935 to 1941, he researched at the Institut für Weltwirtschaft in Kiel. In 1939, Schiller made his habilitation. After taking part in World War II as a soldier from 1941 to 1945, he became professor at the University of Hamburg, where he became principal from 1956 to 1958. In the meantime, from 1948 to 1966, he was a member of the scientific advisory board of the Federal Ministry for Economics.
 
 
 == Political career ==
 Schiller joined the paramilitary Stormtroopers (Sturmabteilung) of the NSDAP in 1933 and the party itself in 1937. After World War II he joined the SPD in 1946.
 From 1965 to 1972, he was a member of the Bundestag for the SPD, where he became assistant chairman of the SPD faction.
 From 1948 to 1953, Schiller was Senator for economy in Hamburg and held the same office again from 1961 to 1965 in Berlin serving under mayor Willy Brandt in his second term of office.
 From 1966 to 1969, he was Federal Minister of Economic Affairs in the grand coalition under Bundeskanzler Kurt Georg Kiesinger, and worked together with Franz Josef Strauß, then Federal Minister of Finance, in the Concerted activity. In this time, they were known as Plisch und Plum after figures invented by Wilhelm Busch.
 In the first cabinet of Willy Brandt, Schiller continued to serve in the previous position, and was also Federal Minister of Finance from 1971 to 1972 after the demission of Alex Möller. On 7 July 1972 Schiller demissioned, thus protesting against Brandt's economic decisions. After stepping down, he soon left the SPD as well. In 1972, he participated together with Ludwig Erhard in a CDU campaign, whereby both acted as defenders of market economy. In 1980 he returned to the SPD. He died in Hamburg.
 As Finance Minister Schiller travelled to the Soviet Union in 1970 and met with Alexei Kosygin, the Premier of the Soviet Union, to discuss a trade agreement between their two respective countries.
 
 
 == Honours ==
 In 1991, Schiller was honoured with the Bundesverdienstkreuz (Grand Cross with Star and Sash).
 Karl-Schiller Berufskolleg is a vocational college in Dortmund named after Schiller. The school was renamed for Schiller in 1999.

Frances Rix Ames (; 20 April 1920 – 11 November 2002) was a South African neurologist, psychiatrist, and human rights activist, best known for leading the medical ethics inquiry into the death of anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko, who died from medical neglect after being tortured in police custody. When the South African Medical and Dental Council (SAMDC) declined to discipline the chief district surgeon and his assistant who treated Biko, Ames and a group of five academics and physicians raised funds and fought an eight-year legal battle against the medical establishment. Ames risked her personal safety and academic career in her pursuit of justice, taking the dispute to the South African Supreme Court, where she eventually won the case in 1985.
 Born in Pretoria and raised in poverty in Cape Town, Ames became the first woman to receive a Doctor of Medicine degree from the University of Cape Town in 1964. Ames studied the effects of cannabis on the brain and published several articles on the subject. Seeing the therapeutic benefits of cannabis on patients in her own hospital, she became an early proponent of legalization for medicinal use. She headed the neurology department at Groote Schuur Hospital before retiring in 1985, but continued to lecture at Valkenberg and Alexandra Hospital. After apartheid was dismantled in 1994, Ames testified at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission about her work on the "Biko doctors" medical ethics inquiry. In 1999, Nelson Mandela awarded Ames the Star of South Africa, the country's highest civilian award, in recognition of her work on behalf of human rights.
 
 
 == Early life ==
 Ames was born at Voortrekkerhoogte in Pretoria, South Africa, on 20 April 1920, to Frank and Georgina Ames, the second of three daughters. Her mother, who was raised in a Boer concentration camp by Ames' grandmother, a nurse in the Second Boer War, was also a nurse. Ames never knew her father, who left her mother alone to raise three daughters in poverty. With her mother unable to care for her family, Ames spent part of her childhood in a Catholic orphanage where she was stricken with typhoid fever. Her mother later rejoined the family and moved them to Cape Town, where Ames attended the Rustenburg School for Girls. She enrolled at the University of Cape Town (UCT) medical school where she received her MBChB degree in 1942.
 
 
 == Medical career ==
 In Cape Town, Ames interned at Groote Schuur Hospital; she also worked in the Transkei region as a general practitioner. She earned her MD degree in 1964 from UCT, the first woman to do so. Ames became head of the neurology department at Groote Schuur Hospital in 1976. She was made an associate professor in 1978. Ames retired in 1985, but continued to work part-time at both Valkenberg and Alexandra Hospital as a lecturer in the UCT Psychiatry and Mental Health departments. In 1997, UCT made Ames an associate professor emeritus of neurology; she received an honorary doctorate in medicine from UCT in 2001. According to Pat Sidley of the British Medical Journal, Ames "was never made a full professor, and believed that this was because she was a woman."
 
 
 == Biko affair ==
 South African anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko, who had formerly studied medicine at the University of Natal Medical School, was detained by Port Elizabeth security police on 18 August 1977 and held for 20 days. Sometime between 6 and 7 September, Biko was beaten and tortured into a coma. According to allegations by Ames and others, surgeon Ivor Lang, along with chief district surgeon Benjamin Tucker, collaborated with the police and covered up the abuse, leading to Biko's death from his injuries on 12 September. According to Benatar & Benatar 2012, "there were clear ethical breaches on the part of the doctors who were responsible" for Biko.
 
 When the South African Medical and Dental Council (SAMDC) along with the support of the Medical Association of South Africa (MASA), declined to discipline the district surgeons in Biko's death, two groups of physicians filed separate formal complaints with the SAMDC regarding the lack of professionalism shown by Biko's doctors. Both cases made their way to the South African Supreme Court in an attempt to force the SAMDC to conduct a formal inquiry into the medical ethics of Lang and Tucker. One case was filed by Ames, along with Trefor Jenkins and Phillip Tobias of the University of the Witwatersrand; a second case was filed by Dumisani Mzana, Yosuf Veriava of Coronationville Hospital, and Tim Wilson of Alexandra Health Centre.As Ames and the small group of physicians pursued an inquiry into members of their own profession, Ames was called a whistleblower. Her position at the university was threatened by her superiors and her colleagues asked her to drop the case. By pursuing the case against the Biko doctors, Ames received personal threats and risked her safety. Baldwin-Ragaven et al. note that the medical association "closed ranks in support of colleagues who colluded with the security police in the torture and death of detainees [and] also attempted to silence and discredit those doctors who stood up for human rights and who demanded disciplinary action against their colleagues."After eight years, Ames won the case in 1985 when the South African Supreme Court ruled in her favor. With Ames' help, the case forced the medical regulatory body to reverse their decision. The two doctors who treated Biko were finally disciplined and major medical reforms followed. According to Benatar & Benatar 2012, the case "played an important role in sensitising the medical profession to medical ethical issues in South Africa."
 
 
 == Cannabis research ==
 Ames studied the effects of cannabis in 1958, publishing her work in The British Journal of Psychiatry as "A clinical and metabolic study of acute intoxication with Cannabis sativa and its role in the model psychoses". Her work is cited extensively throughout the cannabis literature. She opposed the War on Drugs and was a proponent of the therapeutic benefits of cannabis, particularly for people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Ames observed first-hand how cannabis (known as dagga in South Africa) relieved spasm in MS patients and helped paraplegics in the spinal injuries ward of her hospital. She continued to study the effects of cannabis in the 1990s, publishing several articles about cannabis-induced euphoria and the effects of cannabis on the brain.
 
 
 == Personal life ==
 Ames was married to editorial writer David Castle of the Cape Times and they had four sons. She was 47 years old when her husband died unexpectedly in 1967. After her husband's death, Ames's housekeeper Rosalina helped raise the family. Ames wrote about the experience in her memoir, Mothering in an Apartheid Society (2002).
 
 
 == Death ==
 Ames struggled with leukemia for some time. Before her death, she told an interviewer, "I shall go on until I drop." She continued to work for UCT as a part-time lecturer at Valkenberg Hospital until six weeks before she died at home in Rondebosch on 11 November 2002. Representing UCT's psychiatry department, Greg McCarthy gave the eulogy at the funeral. Ames was cremated, and according to her wishes, her ashes were combined with hemp seed and dispersed outside of Valkenberg Hospital where her memorial service was held.
 
 
 == Legacy ==
 South African neurosurgeon Colin Froman referred to Ames as the "great and unorthodox protagonist for the medical use of marijuana many years before the current interest in its use as a therapeutic drug". J. P. van Niekerk of the South African Medical Journal notes that "Frances Ames led by conviction and example" and history eventually justified her action in the Biko affair.Ames's work on the Biko affair led to major medical reforms in South Africa, including the disbanding and replacement of the old apartheid-era medical organisations which failed to uphold the medical standards of the profession. According to van Niekerk, "the most enduring lesson for South African medicine was the clarification of the roles of medical practitioners when there is a question of dual responsibilities. This is now embodied inter alia in the SAMA Code of Conduct and in legal interpretations of doctors' responsibilities".Ames testified during the medical hearings at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1997. Archbishop Desmond Tutu honored Ames as "one of the handful of doctors who stood up to the apartheid regime and brought to book those doctors who had colluded with human rights abuse." In acknowledgement of her work on behalf of human rights in South Africa, Nelson Mandela awarded Ames the Order of the Star of South Africa in 1999, the highest civilian award in the country.

Gérard Debreu (French: [dəbʁø]; 4 July 1921 – 31 December 2004) was a French-born economist and mathematician. Best known as a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, where he began work in 1962, he won the 1983 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.
 
 
 == Biography ==
 His father was the business partner of his maternal grandfather in lace manufacturing, a traditional industry in Calais. Debreu was orphaned at an early age, as his father committed suicide and his mother died of natural causes. Prior to the start of World War II, he received his baccalauréat and went to Ambert to begin preparing for the entrance examination of a grande école. Later on, he moved from Ambert to Grenoble to complete his preparation, both places being in Vichy France during World War II. In 1941, he was admitted to the École Normale Supérieure in Paris, along with Marcel Boiteux. He was influenced by Henri Cartan and the Bourbaki writers. When he was about to take the final examinations in 1944, the Normandy landings occurred and he, instead, enlisted in the French army. He was transferred for training to Algeria and then served in the occupying French forces in Germany until July 1945. Debreu passed the Agrégation de Mathématiques exams at the end of 1945 and the beginning of 1946. By this time, he had become interested in economics, particularly in the general equilibrium theory of Léon Walras. From 1946 to 1948, he was an assistant in the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. During these two and a half years, he made the transition from mathematics to economics. In 1948, Debreu went to the United States on a Rockefeller Fellowship which allowed him to visit several American universities, as well as those in Uppsala and Oslo in 1949–50.
 Debreu married Françoise Bled in 1946 and they had two daughters, Chantal and Florence, born in 1946 and 1950 respectively.
 Debreu died in Paris at the age of 83 of natural causes on New Year's Eve, 2004.
 
 
 == Academic career ==
 Debreu began working as a Research Associate and joined the Cowles Commission at the University of Chicago in the summer of 1950. He remained there for five years, returning to Paris periodically.
 In 1954, he published a breakthrough paper, entitled Existence of an Equilibrium for a Competitive Economy, together with Kenneth Arrow, in which they provided a definitive mathematical proof of the existence of a general equilibrium, using topological rather than calculus-based methods.
 In 1955, he moved to Yale University.
 In 1959, he published his classical monograph, Theory of Value: An Axiomatic Analysis of Economic Equilibrium (Cowles Foundation Monographs Series), which is one of the most important works in mathematical economics. He also studied several problems in the theory of cardinal utility, in particular the additive decomposition of a utility function defined on a Cartesian product of sets.
 In this monograph, Debreu set up an axiomatic foundation for competitive markets. He also established the existence of an equilibrium using a novel approach. The main idea of his argument is to show that there exists a price system for which the aggregate excess demand correspondence vanishes. He did so by proving a type of fixed-point theorem that is based on the Kakutani fixed-point theorem. In Chapter 7, Debreu introduced the concept of uncertainty and showed how it could be incorporated into the deterministic model. Here, he introduced the notion of a contingent commodity, which is a promise to deliver a good should a certain state of nature be realized. This concept is very frequently used in financial economics, where it is known as the "Arrow–Debreu security".
 In 1960–61, he worked at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford and devoted most of his time to the complex proof that appeared in 1962 of a general theorem on the existence of an economic equilibrium.
 In January 1962, he started working at the University of California, Berkeley, where he held the titles of University Professor and Class of 1958 Professor of Economics and Mathematics Emeritus.
 During his sabbaticals in the late 1960s and 1970s, he visited universities in Leiden, Cambridge, Bonn and Paris. In 1987, he visited the University of Canterbury as an Erskine Fellow, lecturing in economic theory.His later studies centred mainly on the theory of differentiable economies, where he showed that, in general, aggregate excess demand functions vanish at a finite number of points – basically, he showed that economies have a finite number of price equilibria.
 In 1976, he received the French Legion of Honour. He was awarded the 1983 Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, for having incorporated new analytical methods into economic theory and for his rigorous reformulation of general equilibrium theory. He was a member of the International Academy of Science.
 In 1990, he served as President of the American Economic Association.

Colin Joseph Bibby (20 November 1948 – 7 August 2004) was a British ornithologist and conservationist.
 Bibby was born in the Wirral, Cheshire, the son of a North Wales farmer.  He was educated at Oundle School, Northamptonshire, and at St John's College, Cambridge, graduating in natural sciences.  He gained his PhD for a classic study on the ecology and conservation of Dartford warblers.Bibby was a research staff member for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds from 1971 to 1986, and the head of Conservation Science from 1986 to 1991. In 1991, he moved to BirdLife International, where he led their research team and a major research program, with projects in over 70 countries. In 2001 he became a self-employed environmental consultant. He was also a member of the Rare Breeding Birds Panel, and the founding editor of the British Trust for Ornithology journal Ringing and Migration.His major contributions were in the development of quantitative approaches to the study of birds for research leading to conservation. He was also a frequent contributor to British Birds magazine.In 1994, he was awarded the Dr A.H. Heineken Prize for Environmental Sciences for his work with BirdLife International, and in June 2004, he received the RSPB Medal in recognition of his contribution to ornithology.
 He learned that he had an incurable cancer in March 2004 and, on 7 August 2004 at the age of 55, died in his sleep. He was survived by his wife, Ruth, and three sons.
 
 
 == Memorials ==
 A special supplement published with Bird Conservation International (Vol 18 No 3, September 2008) was dedicated to Bibby. In it, Mike Rands, BirdLife's Chief Executive, wrote:
 
 Colin Bibby was a truly remarkable man. He had a life-long interest in almost all things biological, and applied scientific thinking and rigour to a vast array of situations, be they the study of a particular conservation problem, or matters concerning the management of an organisation. [He] leaves a great legacy of knowledge and ideas, and this publication pays tribute to his innovative approach to the application of ornithology to conservation.
 In 2017 a stained-glass painting of a Dartford Warbler, in the style of Bibby's favourite artist, Eric Ennion, was added to a window at St Michael and All Angels Church, Caldecote, Cambridgeshire in Bibby's honour. Bibby had spent the months after his fatal diagnosis fundraising for the church windows' restoration. A service of dedication for the memorial painting, on 16 July 2017, led by the Archdeacon of Cambridge, Alex Hughes, was attended by over 100 people.

Hirsh Zvi Griliches ( GRIL-i-kəs; 12 September 1930 – 4 November 1999) was an economist at Harvard University.  The works by Zvi Griliches mostly concerned the economics of technological change, including empirical studies of diffusion of innovations and the role of R & D, patents, and education.
 
 
 == Biography ==
 He was born in Kaunas, Lithuania in an assimilated Jewish family that spoke Russian at home. During World War II he was sent to the Dachau concentration camp. In 1947 he emigrated to Palestine, where he served in the pre-state Israeli army, learned Hebrew, passed high school equivalence exam, and studied for a year at Hebrew University.  He then moved to the United States, where he earned a B.S. in Agricultural Economics from the University of California, Berkeley, and then a Ph.D. in Economics at the University of Chicago, supervised by Theodore Schultz.
 In his classic 1957 Ph.D. dissertation, Hybrid Corn: An Exploration in the Economics of Technological Change, published as an article in the October 1957 issue of Econometrica, Griliches demonstrated that the penetration of corn seeds followed the logistic curve. It was found later through multiple examples by Edwin Mansfield and other researchers that this is a general rule for technological change / diffusion of innovations. The dissertation was one of the first scientific works that treated the development of new technology as an economic phenomenon. Previously, economists had treated it as exogenous.
 Most innovations either make production more efficient, or improve the quality of goods. The analysis of measurement of the impact of innovations on economics led Griliches to his fundamental studies of economic growth, productivity, production function, consumption function, measurements of economic input and output, hedonic prices, and their reflection in price indices.
 Griliches also published important works of econometrics, including distributed lags (time series) and aggregation. He was particularly interested in the measurements of hidden variables.
 Griliches served as the President of the Econometric Society in 1975, and as the President of the American Economic Association in 1993. From 1969 to 1977 he was one of editors of the journal Econometrica. He served on the Stigler Commission in 1961 and the Boskin Commission in 1996, both of which were convened by the United States Senate to evaluate the measurement of inflation.
 In 1965, Zvi Griliches won the prestigious John Bates Clark Medal. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1965 and to the National Academy of Sciences in 1975. He was also elected Distinguished Fellow of the American Economic Association, Fellow of the Econometric Society, Fellow of the American Statistical Association, Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and Fellow of the American Agricultural Economics Association. He died on November 4, 1999, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
 
 
 == Memorials and tributes ==
 The Zvi Griliches Research Data Center was established in his memory at the Samuel Neaman Institute for Advanced Studies in Science and Technology in Israel. The Zvi Griliches Excellence Award was established by the Economics Education and Research Consortium (EERC) in Russia and other former Soviet Union countries.
 The Zvi Griliches Research Seminar in the Economics of Innovation was held by the Barcelona Graduate School of Economics to promote interactions between academic researchers, innovation policy practitioners, statistical office analysts and PhD students with a general interest in analyzing technological innovation from an economic point of view.
 In 2001, in the memory of Zvi Griliches, the International Advisory Board of the New Economic School, with the full approval of the entire NES community, decided to establish an annual series of lectures in economics. “The Zvi Griliches Memorial Lectures” are presented by leading scholars and open for everyone.

Václav Vojta (12 July 1917 in Mokrosuky, Bohemia – 12 September 2000 in Munich, Germany) was a renowned Czech medical doctor who specialized in the treatment of children with cerebral palsy and developmental disorders. He discovered the principle of reflex locomotion, which is used to treat various physical and neuromuscular disorders through the stimulation of the human sensomotoric system's reflex points. Originally used in the treatment of spastic children, the technique is now used on babies and adults.
 
 
 == Biography ==
 
 
 === Early life and education ===
 Vojta began his studies in Prague in 1937, but due to the Nazi occupation, he was forced to postpone them, eventually earning his doctoral degree 10 years later, in 1947. He pursued training in pediatric neurology, working in the clinic at Charles University in Prague, and in 1956, he became head of the Department of Pediatric Neurology at the 4th Neurological Clinic of the Medical Faculty of Charles University in Prague. Dr. Vojta is most noted for his work in developmental kinesiology and his discovery of reflex locomotion therapy, which became broadly known as the Vojta Method. 
 
 
 === Exile in Germany ===
 In 1968, Soviet troops invaded Czechoslovakia, disrupting Vojta’s work and posing a threat to his professional future. Vojta, along with his wife and three small children, sought refuge in Germany. There, Vojta began work as a research fellow at the Orthopedic Clinic of the University of Cologne, pursuing his work in developmental kinesiological studies, and organizing courses in diagnostics and physical therapy. In 1975, Dr. Vojta relocated to Munich, taking a position at the Munich Children’s Centre, where he became head of the rehabilitation department.
 In 1989, after the fall of the communist regime, Vojta returned to his native Czechoslovakia to receive tenure as Professor of Pediatric Neurology and Rehabilitation from Charles University in Prague, an honor denied him as a “politically unreliable person” under the Soviet regime. He was able to teach there once again, and continued to do so until his retirement in 1995. After his retirement, Vojta continued to lecture and teach around the world until his death in 2000.
 
 
 == Career ==
 
 
 === The Vojta Method ===
 Vojta’s research was focused on reflex locomotion therapy, particularly in the treatment of children exhibiting developmental delays. He discovered the basis of reflex locomotion while searching for treatment therapies for children with cerebral palsy and spastic paralysis. He discovered that muscle groups that the children could not activate themselves can be activated by applying pressure to specific zones on a patient’s body. Repeated activation resulted in improved gait, better posture and improved speech in children with cerebral palsy.
 Professor Vojta recognized that many of the movement complexes he found could be traced to common subjective global patterns of movement that mark developmental milestones in healthy children. Although the emphasis of Vojta’s work was initially directed to pediatrics, he very soon recognized that the treatment could also be applied to neurological problems in adult patients. However, Vojta Therapy is most effective in patients under the age of six months, an age when early developmental changes are most profound.
 Vojta therapists use a combination of 10 different zones on a patient's body, applying light pressure on a specific area and resistance to the current movement, causing the patient's body to involuntarily perform certain reflexive movement patterns. Repeated stimulation appears to make previously blocked neurological connections between the patient's spinal cord and brain. The patient is eventually able to perform similar movements without any external stimulation. Vojta Therapy has been used to treat cerebral palsy, peripheral paralysis of the arms and legs, hip dysplasia, and problems in breathing, swallowing and chewing.
 In recent years, the principles underlying Vojta's method have been adapted to Dynamic Neuromuscular Stimulation or DNS, a modern iteration of Vojta therapy. DNS therapy has been successfully used to rehabilitate athletic injury and enhance performance, leading to a reduction in injury, decreased recovery time, and increased performance markers. When an adult athlete or patient is injured, they sometimes revert to an early pattern of locomotion similar to that of a young infant, before proper control was established. For example, a patient with a shoulder impingement may internally rotate and flex their arm in a way similar to a two-month-old child who has not yet developed external rotation and extension. In this case, DNS places an adult patient in a developmental position to re-teach proper control of the shoulder joint.
 While Vojta Therapy has been recognized for decades as a viable treatment method throughout Europe and Asia, it has only recently made inroads in the United States, particularly among physical therapists. As research and practice of the Vojta method grow, Dr. Vojta’s contributions to the fields of physical therapy and physical performance will undoubtedly gain universal recognition. 
 
 
 == Published works and training ==
 Vojta published over 100 scientific works and two textbooks, Cerebral Movement Disturbances in Infancy and The Vojta Principle, written with Anne Peters. Both have appeared in several editions and been translated into several languages. His works have inspired further research and additional scientific works worldwide.
 In 1984, Vojta and his German colleagues formed the Vojta Society, dedicated to promoting and disseminating the principles of reflex locomotion in diagnostics and therapy, with the goal of training physiotherapists and physicians in the Vojta method. In 1998, the organization was renamed the International Vojta Society, over which Professor Vojta presided until his death. The non-profit society, with its headquarters in Munich, runs annual qualification seminars in Germany for health care professionals. Training around 150 doctors and physiotherapists a year, the qualification seminars focus on treatment of new-born babies, children and adults. Before his death, Professor Vojta traveled extensively, conducting seminars and training sessions worldwide.
 
 
 == Awards and recognitions ==
 Vojta received recognition in the form of awards and honors for his work throughout his career. In 1974 he was awarded the Heinrich Heine Prize, the highest award of the German Society for Orthopedics. In 1979 he received the "Growing with Each Other" Medal from the German association Aktion Sonnenschein for his work with disabled children. In 1983, he won the Ernst von Bergmann Prize for training in medicine from the German Medical Association. In 1990, Vojta was awarded the von Pfaundler Medal for training in pediatrics from the Professional Association of Pediatricians. In October 2000, Vojta was posthumously awarded the Czech Order of Merit by Vaclav Havel, the President of the Czech Republic.

Charles Lee Remington (January 19, 1922 – May 31, 2007) was an American entomologist known for studies of butterflies and moths, a Yale University professor, and is considered the father of modern lepidoptery. He established a Periodical Cicada preserve in Hamden, Connecticut. He developed the insect collection at the Peabody Museum of Natural History.   Among species named in his honor are Agathymus remingtoni (the Coahuila giant skipper) and Metajapyx remingtoni, a forcepstail.
 
 
 == Biography ==
 Remington was born to Pardon Sheldon and Maud Remington in Reedville, Virginia, on January 19, 1922. His family then moved to St. Louis, Missouri. He grew up collecting butterflies with his father. He did his undergraduate studies at Principia College, where he received a B.S. in 1943. During his military service in World War II, he served as a medical entomologist, throughout the Pacific, researching insect-borne diseases and centipede bites in the Philippines.After the war, Remington studied for his doctorate at Harvard. He founded the Lepidopterists' Society with Harry Clench and his first wife Jeanne Remington, mother of his three children. Remington also started a friendship with Vladimir Nabokov who was a keen amateur butterfly collector.He started teaching at Yale University in 1948. For the academic year 1958–59, Remington was a Guggenheim fellow at Oxford University. In the 1960s he proposed that there were geographic regions which he called suture zones where species tended to hybridize with close relatives.With Richard Bowers and Paul R. Ehrlich he founded Zero Population Growth. He served on the board of advisors of the Carrying Capacity Network, an organization that supports immigration reduction.He died on May 31, 2007, at age 85, in Hamden, Connecticut.

Li Choh-ming (李卓敏, 1912 – 1991) was a Chinese-born American economist and educator.  He was the founding Vice-Chancellor of the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 1963. He compiled The Li Chinese Dictionary (Cantonese-Mandarin). He was an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley and at Nankai University in Tiensien during his academic career.
 
 
 == Career ==
 Born in Canton, China in 1912 to Kanchi and Mewshing Li,  Choh-Ming Li was the third child and the eldest son in a family of 11 children.  He graduated from Puiying High School in Canton before heading off to the U.S. at the University of California, Berkeley where he earned his B.S. in commerce (1932), M.A. (1933) and Ph.D. in economics (1936).  Eventually, three of his brothers Choh-Hao, Choh-Hsien, Choh-Luh and a sister, Djoh-i, came from China to study various sciences at U.C. Berkeley.Li returned to China to teach economics at Nankai University in Tiensien in 1937. From 1938-1943, Li taught at the National Southwest Associated University (Lianda) when the top three universities in China (Tsinghua, Peking, Nankai) consolidated into one,  moving to Kunming and Chungking as the Sino-Japanese war broke.  Li was among the key economists to bring Western economic ideas into China, both in teaching and serving as China's representative at various international missions. In 1945-47 Li was named Deputy Director-General of the Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA)in Shanghai, to work with the United Nations (UNRRA) in managing the postwar relief and recovery effort in China. As the war ended, Li became China's permanent delegate to the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE) in 1948-49 and Chairman of the Board of Trustees for Rehabilitation Affairs (BOTRA) 1949-50 to help reconstruct China with long-term economic development.
 In 1951 Li immigrated to the U.S. where he began as a lecturer in economics, becoming professor of business administration in 1958, and Chairman of the Center for Chinese Studies (1961) at his alma mater, the University of California-Berkeley.  Upon becoming a U.S. citizen, Li was able to bring his wife Sylvia and family of 2 sons, Winston and Tony, and a daughter Jeannie, to the U.S. from Hong Kong in 1955.
 
 
 == Writing ==
 His scholarly contributions focused on the economic system of Communist China and its performance. His books, the Economic Development of Communist China (1959) and The Statistical System of Communist China (1962) were seminal works before China sealed itself off from outsiders.  Li's continuous study of social and economic problems of China helped establish UC-Berkeley as a center for scholarly research on China.  His expertise in international trade and economics helped establish international business in the School of Business Administration curricula. In 1963 the Government of Hong Kong appointed Choh-Ming Li to head the Chinese University of Hong Kong. With government backing of the U.K. and the U.S., the Board of Regents of the University of California granted him an unprecedented 10-year leave of absence to form and establish the new university. As head, Li was named Vice-Chancellor of the university (in the British tradition, the Governor of Hong Kong was the Chancellor of all Hong Kong colleges and universities).  The new university was founded with the motto “to combine tradition and modernity and to bring together China and the West” by adding the Chinese dimension or data into every academic discipline. From the beginning, English, Cantonese, and Mandarin were the languages of instruction. Student and faculty exchanges with the U.S., the U.K., and other countries were established.  He wrote and oversaw The CUHK publications on the formation and development of the university: The First Six Years 1963-69 (1971), The Emerging University (1975), and A New Era Begins (1979). Li retired from The CUHK in 1978. Li was Professor Emeritus at Berkeley in 1973. Throughout his tenure at The CUHK, Li personally compiled and developed a pictophonetic Cantonese-Mandarin dictionary.  He called his new system of codifying Chinese characters the Fan System. The Li Chinese Dictionary (李氏中文字典, Li shi zhong wen zi dian) was published and distributed in the West and in the People's Republic of China in 1981.Choh-Ming Li received many honors from around the world. Among them were honorary knighthoods, the Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1967 and Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1973.  At The Chinese University of Hong Kong, the medical building is named after him and a life size statue of him sits at the Institute of Chinese Studies.  From the University of California, he received the Elise and Walter A. Haas International Award (1974) and the Clark Kerr Award (1979).

Mary Puthisseril Verghese (1925–1986) was a physician in India who was among the earliest pioneers of Physical medicine and rehabilitation in the country. Mary Verghese was instilled in a home where love and respect were two main factors in their close knit family. She was caring of others and wanted to give back to her community in any way that she could. In 1963, she took charge of what was the first department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation with an inpatient facility in India at the Christian Medical College, Vellore. She was instrumental in expanding the services of the department with the establishment of the first inpatient rehabilitation institute of the country in 1966. In recognition of her contributions to the field of medicine, she was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India in 1972.An award has been instituted in her memory by the Mary Verghese Trust, and the first Dr. Mary Verghese Award for Excellence in Empowering Ability was given in 2012 to S. Ramakrishnan, founder and president of the Amar Seva Sangam. To this day, Mary Verghese is viewed as a respected physician and woman that strived to better peoples lives.
 
 
 == Early life and education ==
 Mary Verghese was born in Cherai village, Cochin, Kerala, India, in a prosperous family. Her father was a respected leader in the local church and community. She was the seventh of eight children in the family. Elder to her were sisters Annamma, Aleyamma, Thankamma, and brothers John, George, and Joseph. Martha was her younger sister. After her schooling at the Union High School in Cherai, Mary attended the Maharaja's College, Ernakulam, for her college studies. After being among seventy-five women to be invited to the Vellore interviews, Mary Verghese was placed on the waiting list. The fifth women dropped and Mary was in. She got to meet Dr. Ida S. Scudder, the founder of the institution, for the first time at the time of her admission to the course. She had her graduate training in medicine at the Christian Medical College, Vellore between 1946 and 1952. She got to meet Dr. Ida S. Scudder, the founder of the institution, for the first time at the time of her admission to the course. On completing her training in medicine, aspiring to specialise in gynaecology, she joined the department of gynaecology. She was devoted to enduring a life that laid down a foundation of faith and medicine through her work in many clinics.
 In addition, she was a Godly woman that aimed to gain a deeper relationship with God while in school. Although she enjoyed spending time with her friends, Mary developed a deep and valuable connection with her religion. Mary found it peaceful and restoring to have her medical education as well as building upon her faith and relationship with God.
 
 
 == Spinal cord injury and later years ==
  After graduating, her and some of her colleagues along with the head of gynecology, Dr. Carol Jameson, were traveling in a car and it was then where she was injured in a road crash in 1954 that resulted in complete spinal cord injury. She became paralysed from the waist down (mid thoracic injury. All of her colleagues involved in the crash recovered, except for Mary. Her injuries were managed by Dr. Paul Brand, who subsequently was her mentor and under whom she learnt surgical skills related to leprosy rehabilitation. Dr Paul Brand pointed out that she could sit in her wheelchair and operate on the hands of people with Hansen's Disease.
 Following a course of rehabilitation at Australian Rehabilitation Center, Perth, Verghese secured a fellowship at the Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, New York, under Dr. Howard A. Rusk, a pioneer in the field. On completing her fellowship in 1962, she returned to India to head the department of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Christian Medical College, Vellore.  She started the rehabilitation institute in 1966, and headed the first fully functional physical rehabilitation unit in the country. She was involved in providing rehabilitation services primarily for persons with spinal cord injury, leprosy, and brain injury. She continued to work at the Christian Medical College till 1976.  Her biography, titled "Take my hand: the remarkable story of Dr. Mary Verghese", authored by Dorothy Clarke Wilson, was published in 1963.
 
 
 == Awards ==
 In recognition of her contributions to medicine, in particular, to the field of physical rehabilitation in India, Mary Verghese was awarded the Padma Shri by the then President of India, Shri. V.V. Giri in 1972. She was awarded the World Vision Award in 1985. These awards encompassed her pioneer work within her community and the everlasting effects that she made. Additionally, the Mary Verghese Trust, and the first Dr. Mary Verghese Award for Excellence in Empowering Ability was given in 2012 in honor of her.
 
 
 == Death and legacy ==
 Verghese died in December 1986 at Vellore. The rehabilitation institute established by her has been named in her honour. The Mary Verghese Trust that was started by her in 1986 continues to conduct vocational training programs for persons with physical disabilities. The trust also jointly conducts the annual get-together program for persons with disabilities, the Rehab Mela. In 2012, Mary Verghese Award Foundation was established.
 
 
 == Rehabilitation Institute, CMC Vellore. ==
 The Mary Varghese Institute of Rehabilitation is part of the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Department of the Christian Medical College Vellore. 
 The Rehabilitation Institute in Bagayam, Vellore continues to help people with disabilities.
 The institute treats people with spinal cord injury, stroke, traumatic brain or head injury, amputations (lost limbs), children with cerebral palsy and many other less common problems. Dr Mary is constantly remembered as the pioneer she was - starting a service that is still going more than 50 years later. As a disabled member in her community with a lack of resources, Dr. Mary returned to India with the Rehabilitation Institute and began to receive patients. Dr. Mary contributed to The Rehabilitation Institute in Bagayam by starting a fund in order to raise money for the people that could not afford these services and disability treatments.
 On top of the inpatient and outpatient clinical departments, The Rehabilitation Institute is a well-rounded facility that has special clinics on different days of the week. With a variety of care, the Rehabilitation Institute in Bagayam continues ongoing research to better prosthetics, have cost effective equipment, incorporate virtual reality with the rehabilitation, and advance research in spinal cord regeneration.
 The institute was inaugurated by the then Union Health Minister Dr. Sushila Nayyar, on 26 November 1966.

James Stemble Duesenberry (July 18, 1918 – October 5, 2009) was an American economist. He made a significant contribution to the Keynesian analysis of income and employment with his 1949 doctoral thesis Income, Saving and the Theory of Consumer Behavior. 
 In Income, Saving and the Theory of Consumer Behavior, Duesenberry questioned basic economic assumptions about consumer behavior. He argued that consumer theory failed to take into account the importance of habit formation in establishing spending patterns. He also stressed the importance of social environment in determining an individual's level of expenditures. He proposed a mechanism called the "demonstration effect" by which people would modify their consumption patterns, not because of changes in income or prices, but from witnessing the consumption expenditures of others that they came into contact with. This phenomena, he argued, was driven by the interdependence of people's preferences and the need to maintain or increase one's social status and prestige. The strong social component driving people's consumption was a key aspect in his formulation of a distinct theory of consumption called the Relative income hypothesis. By this theory, an individual's consumption and savings rate is more dependent on their income relative to those in their community than on their absolute level of income. 
 
 
 == Reception ==
 While some contemporaries of Duesenberry saw his work as a large contribution to the field, it failed to gain significant traction. Kenneth Arrow believed that Duesenberry's work offered "one of the most significant contributions of the postwar period to our understanding of economic behavior".Today, however, the work of Duesenberry is largely absent from standard economics textbooks. Yet some, such as Robert H. Frank, argue that it outperforms the alternative theories that displaced it in the 1950s, such as Milton Friedman's Permanent income hypothesis. Frank claims that Duesenberry's theory can explain why the rich tend to save at higher rates than the poor. Even as national income increases, the higher visible consumption of the rich encourages increased spending across other income levels. Additionally, Duesenberry's recognition of the importance of habit formation aligns the observed short-run rigidity of consumption, as families attempt to maintain their previous standard of living even during recessions.
 
 
 == Background ==
 Duesenberry attended the University of Michigan, where he earned his Bachelor of Arts in 1939, his Master of Arts in 1941, and his Doctor of Philosophy in 1948. He served as professor of economics at Harvard University from 1955–1989.
 Duesenberry served on the Council of Economic Advisers under President Lyndon Johnson from 1966–68.

Grote Reber (December 22, 1911 – December 20, 2002) was an American pioneer of radio astronomy, which combined his interests in amateur radio and amateur astronomy. He was instrumental in investigating and extending Karl Jansky's pioneering work, and conducted the first sky survey in the radio frequencies.His 1937 radio antenna was the second ever to be used for astronomical purposes and the first parabolic reflecting antenna to be used as a radio telescope. For nearly a decade he was the world's only radio astronomer.
 
 
 == Life ==
 Reber was born and raised in Wheaton, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, and graduated from Armour Institute of Technology (now Illinois Institute of Technology) in 1933 with a degree in electrical engineering. He was an amateur radio operator, and worked for various radio manufacturers in Chicago from 1933 to 1947.
 When he learned of Karl Jansky's work in 1933, he decided this was the field he wanted to work in, and applied to Bell Labs, where Jansky was working. However, this was during the height of the Great Depression and there were no jobs available.
 
 
 === Early experimentation ===
 
 In the summer of 1937, Reber decided to build his own radio telescope in his back yard in Wheaton, IL. Reber's radio telescope was considerably more advanced than Jansky's, and consisted of a parabolic sheet metal dish 9 meters in diameter, focusing to a radio receiver 8 meters above the dish. The entire assembly was mounted on a tilting stand, allowing it to be pointed in various directions, though not turned. The telescope was completed in September 1937.Reber's first receiver operated at 3300 MHz and failed to detect signals from outer space, as did his second, operating at 900 MHz. Finally, his third attempt, at 160 MHz, was successful in 1938, confirming Jansky's discovery. In 1940, he achieved his first professional publication, in the Astrophysical Journal, but Reber refused a research appointment with Yerkes Observatory. He turned his attention to making a radiofrequency sky map, which he completed in 1941 and extended in 1943.  He published a considerable body of work during this era, and was the initiator of the "explosion" of radio astronomy in the immediate post-Second World War era.  His data, published as contour maps showing the brightness of the sky in radio wavelengths, revealed the existence of radio sources such as Cygnus A and Cassiopeia A for the first time. For nearly a decade from 1937 on he was the world's only radio astronomer, a field that only expanded after World War Two when scientists, who had gained a great deal of knowledge during the wartime expansion of RADAR, entered the field, starting with Project Diana.
 During this time he uncovered a mystery that was not explained until the 1950s. The standard theory of radio emissions from space was that they were due to black-body radiation, light (of which radio is a non-visible form) that is given off by all hot bodies. Using this theory one would expect that there would be considerably more high-energy light than low-energy, due to the presence of stars and other hot bodies. However Reber demonstrated that the reverse was true, and that there was a considerable amount of low-energy radio signal. It was not until the 1950s that synchrotron radiation was offered as an explanation for these measurements.
 Reber sold his telescope to the National Bureau of Standards, and it was erected on a turntable at their field station in Sterling, Virginia. Eventually the telescope made its way to the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia, and Reber supervised its reconstruction at that site.  Reber also helped with a reconstruction of Jansky's original telescope.
 
 
 === Medium frequency research ===
 
 Starting in 1951, he received generous support from the Research Corporation in New York, and moved to Hawaii. In the 1950s, he wanted to return to active studies but much of the field was already filled with very large and expensive instruments. Instead he turned to a field that was being largely ignored, that of medium frequency (hectometre) radio signals in the 0.5–3 MHz range, around the AM broadcast bands. However, signals with frequencies below 30 MHz are reflected by an ionized layer in the Earth's atmosphere called the ionosphere. In 1954, Reber moved to Tasmania, the southernmost state of Australia, where he worked with Bill Ellis at the University of Tasmania. There, on very cold, long, winter nights the ionosphere would, after many hours shielded from the sun's radiation by the bulk of the Earth, 'quieten' and de-ionize, allowing the longer radio waves into his antenna array. Reber described this as being a "fortuitous situation". Tasmania also offered low levels of man-made radio noise, which permitted reception of the faint signals from outer space.
 In the 1960s, he had an array of dipoles set up on the sheep grazing property of Dennistoun, about 7.5 km northeast of the town of Bothwell, Tasmania, where he lived in a house of his own design and construction he decided to build after he purchased a job lot of coach bolts at a local auction. He imported 4x8 douglas fir beams directly from a sawmill in Oregon, and then high technology double glazed window panes, also from the US. The bolts held the house together. The window panes formed a north facing passive solar wall, heating mat black painted, dimpled copper sheets, from which the warmed air rose by convection. The interior walls were lined with reflective rippled aluminium foil. The house was so well thermally insulated that the oven in the kitchen was nearly unusable because the heat from it, unable to escape, would raise the temperature of the room to over 50 °C (120 °F).
 
 
 === Final years ===
 His house was never completely finished.  It was meant to have a passive heat storage device, in the form of a thermally insulated pit full of dolerite rocks, underneath, but although his mind was sharp, his body started to fail him in his later years, and he was never able to move the rocks. He was fascinated by mirrors and had at least one in every room.
 He had one of the amplifiers from the prime focus of his first telescope, probably the one used at 900 MHz. It was of compact point-to-point construction and used two R.C.A. type 955 "acorn" thermionic valves. All the rubber-insulated wires in it had perished and the rubber was hard and crumbly. He powered this amplifier, and all his later receivers at Dennistoun, from batteries, to avoid interference entering the equipment along power cables.
 
 Reber was not a believer of the big bang theory; he believed that red shift was due to repeated absorption and re-emission or interaction of light and other electromagnetic radiations by low density dark matter, over intergalactic distances, and he published an article called "Endless, Boundless, Stable Universe", which outlined his theory. Reber was supportive of the Tired light explanation for the redshift-distance relationship.He was looked after in his final days at the Ouse District Hospital, about 50 km northwest of Hobart, Tasmania, where he died in 2002, two days before his 91st birthday. His ashes are located at Bothwell Cemetery, just past New Norfolk in Tasmania and at many major radio observatories around the world:

Ansley Johnson Coale (November 14, 1917 – November 5, 2002), was one of America's foremost demographers. A native to Baltimore, Maryland, he earned his Bachelor of Arts in 1939, his Master of Arts in 1941, and (after a period of service in the Navy) his Ph.D. in 1947, all at Princeton University.  A long-term director of the Office of Population Research at Princeton, Coale was especially influential for his work on the demographic transition and for his leadership of the European                                                                                                                                       Fertility Project.
 
 
 == Early childhood and education ==
 Ansley Coale was the youngest of three children born from Nellie and James Coale. One year after he was born, his family moved to Cleveland, Ohio, where he spent most of his early years receiving an "excellent" education.The Coale family moved to Annapolis, Maryland, in 1928. Ansley Coale attended a public high school starting in 1930. His intentions were to enroll in Princeton University like his older brother, Jim, did in 1933. By the time Ansley was 16 years old, he was ready to graduate high school. After an extra year at the Mercersburg Academy, a preparatory school, he was accepted into Princeton. This extra year of education was not only important for his intellectual development, but he ended up having 18 companions from the academy that also went to Princeton.After he obtained his Bachelor's of Arts (BA) and master's degree in economics, Ansley Coale was offered a fellowship by the director of the Office of Population Research, Frank Notestein, as long as demography was a field of study. Over the years, the two of them became well-known demographers. In 1947, six years after he received his master's degree, Ansley Coale obtained his Ph.D.
 
 
 == Works ==
 In addition to being the William Church Osborne Professor of Public Affairs Emeritus and professor of economics emeritus at Princeton University, Coale was a prolific author, publishing more than 125 books and articles on a wide variety of demographic topics. His Growth and Structure of Human Populations (1972) is considered an essential textbook for those interested in formal demography. He also trained and served as a mentor to many students who would become leaders in the field.
 Coale joined the faculty at Princeton in 1947, the same year he received his Ph.D. at the same site. He spent his entire academic career at the University's Office of Population Research, serving as director from 1959 to 1975. He was president of the Population Association of America in 1967–68 and president of the International Union for the Scientific Study of Population (IUSSP) from 1977 to 1981.Coale's first major influential work was Population Growth and Economic Development in Low-Income Countries (1958), which he co-wrote with Edgar Hoover. The results, which showed that slowing population growth could enhance economic development, had a major impact on public policy and set the research agenda in this field.
 This study was followed by Regional Model Life Tables and Stable Populations (1966), which he co-wrote with Paul Demeny. These model life tables both established new empirical regularities and proved invaluable in the development of later techniques for estimating mortality and fertility in populations with inaccurate or incomplete data. Along with William Brass, Coale pioneered the development and use of these techniques, first explained in Methods of Estimating Basic Demographic Measures From Incomplete Data (1967, with Demeny) and in The Demography of Tropical Africa (1968, with other demographers).
 Perhaps Coale's most major scientific contribution was to the understanding of the demographic transition. The Demographic Transition, as stated by Coale, occurs when a country develops a strong economy, and within the society, low fertility and mortality will start to reflect based upon the economic standpoint. Coale was the pioneer of the European Fertility Project, which examined the decline in marital fertility in Europe. The European Fertility Project's goal was to correlate the fertility rates within married couples with the rate of infant mortality. Coale established three pre-conditions to fertility decline. The first is "within the conscious of choice." In other words, it is up to the individual and within their own decision whether or not to have children. The second is that if a society sees not having children as advantageous, then fertility will decline. The third pre-condition is to have contraception methods ready. It is important to emphasize that a society will start to show signs of fertility decline if these three pre-conditions are met.Initiated in 1963, the project resulted in the publication of nine major books summarizing the change in childbearing over a century in the 700 provinces in Europe. The Project findings eventually led to the conclusion that even though economical factors can play a role in fertility decline, this is not the absolute determinant of fertility decline. The European Fertility Project led to a better understanding that infant mortality and fertility decline do not necessarily follow each other.
 With a long-time interest in the population of Russia, which first found outlet in Coale's work on the life tables that he constructed for Frank Lorimer's classic The Population of the Soviet Union (1946), Coale also later co-authored a volume on Russia for the European Fertility Project series.Toward the end of his career, Coale became interested in the population changes in China and understanding the fertility transition there as well as factors affecting the sex ratio at birth. In a 1986 study he conducted, India and China were compared in both their population size and fertility trends. A survey named the "1/1000 Fertility Survey" reached out to women living in various provinces of China and asked them to relate a brief history of their marital status and a family planning discussion. The survey contributed to an understanding of the population and fertility changes that would occur in China shortly after. Published in a Journal article called Population trends in China and India, Coale introduced the possible causes of differences in fertility trends in such highly populated countries. These reasons are based on policies put in place to reduce birth rates as well as some cultural differences that come into play. Finally, Coale presents the future of both countries and states that despite the efforts to reduce birth rates, the countries will remain the most populated.

Charles Poor "Charlie" Kindleberger (October 12, 1910 – July 7, 2003) was an American economic historian and author of over 30 books. His 1978 book Manias, Panics, and Crashes, about speculative stock market bubbles, was reprinted in 2000 after the dot-com bubble. He is well known for his role in developing what would become hegemonic stability theory, arguing that a hegemonic power was needed to maintain a stable international monetary system. He has been referred to as "the master of the genre" on financial crisis by The Economist.
 
 
 == Life ==
 
 
 === Background ===
 Kindleberger was born in New York City on October 12, 1910. He graduated from the Kent School in 1928, the University of Pennsylvania in 1932, and received a PhD from Columbia University in 1937.During the summer of 1931, he traveled to Europe and attended a seminar hosted by Salvador de Madariaga, but, when the latter was appointed Spanish Ambassador to the United States, Kindleberger attended lectures at the Institute for International Studies in Geneva led by Sir Alfred Zimmern.
 
 
 === Government ===
 
 
 ==== Treasury ====
 While writing his thesis, Kindleberger was employed temporarily in the international division of United States Treasury under the direction of Harry Dexter White.  He then joined the Federal Reserve Bank of New York full-time (1936–1939). Subsequently, he worked at the Bank for International Settlements in Switzerland (1939-1940), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (1940–1942).  During World War II, he served in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS).  From 1945 to 1947 he was Chief of the Division of Economic Affairs of Germany and Austria at the United States Department of State.
 
 
 ==== Marshall Plan ====
 Kindleberger was a leading architect of the Marshall Plan. In 1945–1947 he served at the Department of State as Acting Director of the Office of Economic Security Policy, and briefly from 1947-48 as counselor for the European Recovery Program.
 He described his around-the-clock work to develop and launch the Marshall Plan with singular passion in a 1973 interview:  We were conscious of a great sense of excitement about the plan. Marshall himself was a great, great man—funny, odd but great—Olympian in his moral quality. We'd stay up all night, night after night. The first work ever done that I know about in economics on computers used the Pentagon's computers at night for the Marshall Plan. I had a tremendous sense of gratification from working so hard on it.
 
 
 ==== Harry Dexter White ====
 Though he himself was spared anti-communist investigation during the 1950s, he later recalled:  ...I worked in the Treasury under Harry Dexter White.  That gave me a lot of trouble later on because he got in trouble, and anybody who was infected by him got into trouble, too.  The FBI listened to my phone calls and things I said in the course of my work at the State Department and gave gossip and some misrepresentations to columnists like George Sokolsky.  J. Edgar Hoover fed them such gossip.
 
 
 === Academia ===
 After 1948, Kindleberger was appointed Professor of International Economics at MIT. He retired from a full-time position in 1976 and continued as a senior lecturer until full retirement from teaching in 1981.He partook in working groups of the Council on Foreign Relations. He later held the position of Ford International Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
 
 
 === Honors ===
 1944 Bronze Star
 1945 Legion of Merit
 1966 Dr. h.c., University of Paris
 1977 Dr. h.c., University of Ghent
 1978 Harms Prize, Institut für Weltwirtschaft, Kiel
 1984 Dr. Sci. h.c., University of Pennsylvania
 1989 Bicentennial Medal, Georgetown University
 
 
 === Personal ===
 Kindleberger was married to Sarah Miles Kindleberger for 59 years.  They had four children: Charles P. Kindleberger III, Richard S. Kindleberger (a reporter for the Boston Globe), Sarah Kindleberger, and E. Randall Kindleberger.He died of a stroke on July 7, 2003, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
 
 
 == Work ==
 Kindleberger wrote 30 books, one, International Short-Term Capital Movements, in 1937 and the other 29 beginning in 1950.
 As economic historian Kindleberger used a narrative approach to knowledge and not based on mathematical models to prove his point.  In the preface to The Great Depression 1929-1939, he wrote "It's the story simply told, without tables of squares..."His book Manias, Panics, and Crashes is still widely used in programs Master of Business Administration (MBA) in the United States.
 
 
 === Hegemonic stability theory ===
 
 In his 1973 and 1986 book The World in Depression 1929–1939, Kindleberger advances an idiosyncratic, internationalist view of the causes and nature of the Great Depression, that concludes that a world hegemon is necessary for a generally stable world economy. Blaming the peculiar length and depth of the Depression on the hesitancy of the US in taking over leadership of the world economy when Britain was no longer up to the role after World War I, he concludes that "for the world economy to be stabilized, there has to be a stabilizer—one stabilizer", by which, in the context of the interwar years at least, he means the United States. In the last chapter, "An Explanation of the 1929 Depression", Kindleberger lists the five responsibilities the US would have had to assume in order to stabilize the world economy:
 
 maintaining a relatively open market for distress goods;
 providing countercyclical, or at least stable, long-term, lending;
 policing the relative stability of exchange rates;
 ensuring the coordination of nations' macroeconomic policies;
 acting as a lender of last resort by discounting, or otherwise providing liquidity, in a financial crisis.Kindleberger was highly skeptical of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz's monetarist view of the causes of the Depression, seeing it as too narrow and perhaps dogmatic, and dismisses out of hand what he characterized as Paul Samuelson's "accidental" or "fortuitous" interpretation. The World in Depression was praised by John Kenneth Galbraith as 'the best book on the subject'.
 For Kindleberger, the main problem with international institutions is that they provide public goods whose provision states are incentivized to free-ride on. Following Mancur Olson, Kindleberger argued that the solution to the free-riding problem was to have an actor who was large enough (a hegemon) and willing to bear the cost of cooperation alone.

Alberto Ullastres (15 January 1914 – 15 November 2001) was Spain's minister of economy (1957-1965) and ambassador to the European Economic Community (1965-1976) under General Franco. He pushed forward the so-called Stabilization Plan which brought about Spain's transition from economic autarchy to liberalization and internationalization of the national economy, an economic success which has been called the Spanish miracle. Ullastres was part of the so-called "Opusdeistas" – ministers under Franco who were also members of the Opus Dei organisation.
 
 
 == Life ==
 He was born in Madrid on 15 January 1914 and died in Madrid on 15 November 2001. 
 He studied law and commerce. He obtained a doctorate in law from the University of Madrid. He was university professor (catedratico) for political economy.
 
 
 == Economic studies and work ==
 Because of the so-called Spanish miracle, which has been attributed to him and the other Spanish technocrats, Ullastres has been counted among the "great economists". He studied the economic doctrines of the School of Salamanca of the 16th and 17th centuries, especially the doctrine of Juan de Mariana and of Martín de Azpilcueta.
 In an article "The Awakening Land", Time magazine attributed Spain's economic modernization to him: "On a hot July day in 1959, Ullastres announced a sweeping stabilization plan. Credit was tightened, the budget slashed, the peseta devalued to a realistic 60 to the dollar. With the aid of a $400 million international loan, Ullastres threw open Spain's doors to imports necessary to rebuild its economy. And over the howls of government protectionists, he pushed through a series of measures to encourage foreign investors to enter Spain. The success of the stabilization plan was miraculous. By 1963 Spain had $1.1 billion in foreign reserves and a booming economy."

Heinz Sielmann (2 June 1917 – 6 October 2006) was a German wildlife photographer, biologist, zoologist and documentary filmmaker.
 
 
 == Early life ==
 Heinz's father was physician Paul Sielmann.His first film, in 1938, was a silent movie on bird life in East Prussia and the Memelland. Further work was interrupted by World War II. He was initially stationed in occupied Poland in Poznań (then "Posen"), as an instructor at a radio-communications training unit of the Luftwaffe. Sielmann gained a degree in biology and specialized in zoology, in 1940, at the University of Posen, at that time a Germanized university. There he met Joseph Beuys, who was his trainee, and they both attended lectures in biology and zoology. Later he was stationed in Crete, where he worked in cinematographically. Following time as a prisoner of war of the British in Cairo and London he started editing the material from Crete in London for a three-part documentary.
 
 
 == Career ==
 After the war he began widely recognized work for the Educational Film Institute of the Federal Republic of Germany. His feature film about woodpeckers, Carpenters of the Forest (Zimmerleute des Waldes, 1954; UK title: Woodpecker) was a huge success in the United Kingdom when broadcast by the BBC in 1955 at the behest of Sir Peter Scott. It earned Sielmann the nickname "Mr Woodpecker".
 His work includes the movies Lords of the Forest (better known in the USA under its title Masters of the Congo Jungle) (1959), the English version narrated by Orson Welles; Galapagos – Dream Island in the Pacific (1962); Vanishing Wilderness (1973); and The Mystery of Animal Behavior.
 During the collaboration on some National Geographic wildlife documentaries in the late 1960s he met Walon Green with whom he worked as additional photographer on the Academy Award-winning documentary The Hellstrom Chronicle about insects in 1971. Sielmann was awarded the Royal Geographical Society's Cherry Kearton Medal and Award in 1973. He was also cinematographer on the American wildlife documentary, Birds do it..., Bees do it... in 1974.
 He was mentioned in the 1974 Monty Python's Flying Circus episode "Blood, Devastation, Death, War, and Horror".
 In 1994 he established the Heinz Sielmann-Stiftung, which successfully reintroduced beavers and otters in Germany.
 His first television work for German Television began in 1956 and his series Expeditionen ins Tierreich (Expeditions into the Animal Kingdom), broadcast on national German television from 1965 to 1991 in 152 installments, made him a household name.
 
 
 == Death and legacy ==
 Sielmann died aged 89 in Munich and was buried in the German town of Duderstadt.
 A Google Doodle honoring his 101st birthday appeared on 2 June 2018.

Leo M. Cherne (1912–1999) was an American economist, public servant, and four-decade head of the International Rescue Committee.
 
 
 == Background ==
 Leo M. Cherne was born on September 8, 1912, in The Bronx.  His father, Max Cherne, was a Romanian-Jewish compositor, who emigrated from Bessarabia to New York in 1904.  Cherne graduated from New York Law School in 1935.
 
 
 == Career ==
 First, Cherne practiced law.
 
 
 === Research Institute of America ===
 During the New Deal, he specialized in Social Security and, with a Bible salesman named Carl Hovgard, sold a book about it. This venture grew into the Research Institute of America (RIA), founded to translate complex government legislation for the businessman.  During World War II, he advised government on industry mobilization; after the war, he advised General Douglas MacArthur on how to reconstruct the economy of Japan.  In 1947, Cherne, as executive secretary of the RIA, had Academy Films make a 30-minute counter-attacking movie called Crossroads for America.  It came in response to the pro-union Deadline for Action. Carl Marzani of Union Films had made the 40-minute documentary Deadline for Action on behalf of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE) and "severely criticized powerful corporations such as General Electric and Westinghouse," whose workers the UE had organized.  At a press conference on 1 October 1947, Cherne presented his film by claiming, "Avoidance of another major depression by steadily increasing productivity is the surest means to thwart Communist designs against the American economic and social system."  Cherne also claimed that the film showed "methods whereby American business concerns can counteract Communist influence on rank-and-file workers by supplying them with truthful statements."
 
 
 === International Rescue Committee (IRC) ===
 In 1946, Cherne joined the board of the  International Rescue Committee (IRC).  In 1951, he became IRC chairman. In 1956, he personally helped deliver medical supplies over the border during the Hungarian uprising.  He went to Cuba in the early 1960s, Cambodia in 1975, and Kenya in 1977. Eventually, Cherne succeeded theologian Reinhold Niebuhr as IRC chairman. He resigned in 1991.
 
 
 === Other activities ===
 Although anti-Communist, Cherne challenged US Senator Joseph McCarthy in 1952.Cherne was a public policy expert who became a principal co-anchor of ABC-TV's All-Star News, the first hour-long prime time nightly network news broadcast, in the 1952-1953 television season. While not a ratings success against entertainment programs on NBC and CBS, All-Star News is credited as pointing the way toward the format later used by long-form local news broadcasts in cities across America in the 1960s and beyond and by CNN and other national and international cable news networks since 1980.  Cherne served as chairman of the executive committee of Freedom House, established to advance the struggle for freedom at home and abroad.Cherne advised nine presidents by serving as a member of the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board from 1973 to 1991. He was also a member of the U.S. Select Committee for Western Hemisphere Immigration and the U.S. Advisory Commission on International Educational and Cultural Affairs.
 
 
 == Personal life and death ==
 Cherne was a gifted sculptor. His bust of Albert Schweitzer was displayed in the Smithsonian, his head of Abraham Lincoln in the Cabinet Room of the White House, and his bust of John F. Kennedy is in the National Portrait Gallery.William F. Buckley Jr. called Cherne "one of the most combative men ever bred... If he thought he was right about something, he would spend from now until doomsday pressing his view."Leo Cherne died age 86 on January 12, 1999, in New York.
 
 
 == Awards ==
 In 1971, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.In 1984, US President Ronald Reagan awarded Cherne the Medal of Freedom for his "moral passion" in the service of refugees.In 1989, Cherne received the S. Roger Horchow Award for Greatest Public Service by a Private Citizen, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.
 
 
 == Miscellaneous ==
 Cherne may have been the actual source of a popular quotation, often misattributed to Albert Einstein: "The computer is incredibly fast, accurate, and stupid. Man is incredibly slow, inaccurate, and brilliant. The marriage of the two is a force beyond calculation."
