sherman `` shay '' minton ( october <days> , <year> – april <days> , <year> ) was a united states senator from indiana and later an associate justice of the supreme court of the united states . he was a member of the democratic party . after attending college and law school , minton served as a captain in world war i , following which he launched a legal and political career . in <year> , after multiple failed election attempts , and serving as a regional leader in the american legion , he became a utility commissioner under the administration of indiana governor paul v. mcnutt . four years later minton was elected to the united states senate . during the campaign , he defended new deal legislation in a series of addresses in which he suggested it was not necessary to uphold the united states constitution during the great depression . minton 's campaign was denounced by his political opponents , and he received more widespread criticism for an address that became known as the `` you can not eat the constitution '' speech . as part of the new deal coalition , minton championed president franklin d. roosevelt 's unsuccessful court packing plans in the senate and became one of his top senate allies . after minton failed in his <year> senate reelection bid , roosevelt appointed him as a united states circuit judge of the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit . after roosevelt 's death , president harry s. truman , who had developed a close friendship with minton during their time together in the senate , nominated him to the supreme court . he was confirmed by the senate on october <days> , <year> , by a vote of <integer> to <integer> , <integer> republicans and one democrat ( harry flood byrd of virginia ) voting against him . he served on the supreme court for seven years . an advocate of judicial restraint , minton was a regular supporter of the majority opinions during his early years on the court ; he became a regular dissenter after president dwight eisenhower 's appointees altered the court 's composition . in <year> , poor health forced minton to retire , after which he traveled and lectured until his death in <year> . according to historians , minton 's judicial philosophy was largely a reaction to the relationship between the new deal senators and the conservative 1930s court , which ruled much of the new deal legislation unconstitutional . minton believed the supreme court should be more deferential to the political branches of government , and supported a broad interpretation of the powers of congress . he generally opposed any effort to rule federal legislation unconstitutional on the principle that the court was overstepping its authority . as a result of his judicial philosophy , he sought to uphold the intent of the political branches of government . historians note the unusual contrast this created between his role as a partisan liberal senator and his role as a conservative jurist . when minton became a justice , the senate had become more conservative , leading minton to uphold the constitutionality and intention of conservative legislation . he often played peacemaker and consensus builder during a period when the court was riven by feuds . he generally ruled in favor of order over freedom as a result of his broad interpretation of governmental powers . these rulings and their limited impact gave some historians a negative opinion of his judicial record . other historians consider minton 's strong commitment to his judicial principles laudable . in <year> , the sherman minton bridge in southern indiana and the minton-capehart federal building in indianapolis were named in his honor . == early life == === family and background === sherman minton was born on october <days> , <year> , to john evan and emma livers minton , in their georgetown , indiana , home . he was the third of the family 's five children and was nicknamed shay because of his younger brother 's inability to properly pronounce `` sherman '' . minton 's paternal grandfather , jonathan minton , was killed during the american civil war and his father grew up on his own . minton 's parents married in 1883.minton received his basic education in a two-room schoolhouse in georgetown he attended through eighth grade . he was exposed to politics from an early age ; his father took him to several political rallies , including an <year> speech by democratic party leader william jennings bryan . his father was a day laborer for the new albany and st. louis air line railway . in <year> , he became disabled when he suffered heat stroke while working . his condition meant he could not work ; the family became impoverished and had to subsist on the limited yield of their small farm . minton 's mother developed breast cancer in <year> . a traveling doctor attempted to remove her tumors <days> april <year> , performing the operation with her laid on the family dinner table , but she died during the procedure . the death was an emotional blow to minton ; thereafter , he refused to attend church and spoke against god , whom he blamed for his mother 's death . minton 's father married sarah montague on december <days> , 1901.as minton grew older , he was frequently in trouble with people in his neighborhood . in <year> he was arrested for disregarding a town ordinance forbidding bicyclists to ride on the sidewalk . he was taken before a justice of the peace and fined three dollars , an incident he later credited with changing his outlook on life and sparking his desire to become a lawyer . to accomplish that , and continue supporting his family , he traveled with his older brother herbert to fort worth , texas , to take a job at the swift and company meatpacking plant . his father and younger siblings soon joined him there after the two brothers ' income was able to cover their expenses . after saving enough money to help establish the family in a new home , minton returned to indiana to attend high school , leaving his family in texas . === education === minton started at edwardsville high school in <year> , aged <integer> . the next year the school merged with nearby new albany high school . there he participated in the football , baseball , and track teams . he founded the school 's first debate club , the wranglers , which won several awards . he worked in a local arcade , and during summer vacations returned to fort worth to work at the swift plant . he was briefly expelled from school after committing a prank <days> february <year> . the school was under the guidance of the innovative superintendent charles allen prosser , who let minton return only after he formally apologized before the entire school a week later . minton began dating gertrude gurtz in his senior year , and the two remained in regular correspondence after he left for college . he graduated high school at the top of his class in 1910.minton was intent on attending college ; during the summer of <year> , he took a job as a swift company salesman in the fort worth area to help pay his way . he returned to indiana and enrolled at indiana university bloomington <days> september <year> , taking enough classes to complete his first three years of courses in two years . despite the heavy workload , he joined the school 's baseball and debate teams , and participated in the jackson club , an organization for democrats . his college years had significant influence on his future political career . he became friends with future governor of indiana paul v. mcnutt , future presidential candidate wendell l. willkie , and several other men who became influential in the state . during his second year he ran out of money , but could not return to texas to earn more because of his class schedule . he lodged in the phi delta theta ( φδθ ) international fraternity house and subsisted mostly on wild berries , leftover bread from the cafeteria and free milk . he completed undergraduate school at the top of his class in <year> . in <year> he graduated from the indiana university school of law in bloomington , at what is now known as the indiana university maurer school of law . during law school , he played end and fullback for the indiana university football team.minton ranked first in his class . this placement entitled him to serve as librarian at the legal college . the position paid a fair salary and allowed him to live more comfortably for his last two years of school . he graduated from law school in <year> , again at the top of his class , and won a one-year scholarship to take post-graduate courses at yale law school , where he earned a master of laws degree . at yale he focused on studying constitutional law and attended the regular lectures of former president and future chief justice of the united states william howard taft . his ll.m . thesis at yale was titled `` theory of the action . '' taft said that minton 's post-graduate thesis was among the best he had ever read . along with lewis f. powell jr. , minton is one of two united states supreme court justices to have earned an ll.m . degree . minton continued to improve his oratory and debate at yale ; he won the wayland club prize for extemporaneous public speaking , and helped organize the university 's legal aid society . === legal career and world war i === <days> may <year> , minton returned to new albany , where he opened a law practice and renewed his relationship with gurtz . he took several cases and gained experience working pro bono to assist the local county prosecutor . he joined the chautauqua lecture circuit , and traveled to several cities to give speeches . during one lecture circuit , he met william jennings bryan , who advised minton about politics , inspiring him to consider a career in public life.in <year> , just after the united states declared war on germany and entered world war i , minton enlisted in the united states army . he took an officers training course at fort benjamin harrison in hope of earning a commission , but was not among those chosen to become an officer . in august <days> was granted a brief leave of absence ; he returned to new albany , where he married gurtz on august <days> . he returned to camp <days> september and requested to repeat his training course , still hoping to receive a commission ; after finishing the training he was commissioned as a captain . the american expeditionary forces , eighty-fourth division , to which minton belonged , was dispatched to france <days> july <year> . minton and his unit served on the western front at verdun , soissons , and later protecting supply lines in belgium . during most of his time in the war , his unit was responsible for scouting roads to ensure safe transport of men and supplies to the front lines . he saw no combat.when president woodrow wilson came to paris in <year> , minton was in charge of a security detail guarding the negotiation hall and met him . when the war ended , minton remained briefly with the army of occupation in germany before being discharged <days> august <year> . he chose to remain in paris for several months to study roman law , international law , civil law and jurisprudence at the university of paris . he returned home <days> march <year> . the first of minton 's three children , sherman jr. , was born while he was away . minton 's daughter mary-anne was born in <year> , and his second son , john , in <year> . == political career == when minton returned home he reopened his law practice and decided to enter politics . he ran for office in indiana 's 3rd congressional district , but lost the democratic primary , despite significant campaigning and his war record . he lost to john ewing , 6,502 votes to 3,170 , second place in a field of five candidates . after the loss , he briefly joined the indiana law firm of stonsenburg and weathers , two politically active lawyers , before moving to miami , florida , where he joined another firm , shutts & bowen . <days> january <year> , he left the miami practice and returned to stonsenburg and weathers . he attempted to secure the democratic nomination to run for congress in <year> , but was again defeated , this time by the former state party chairman eugene b. crowe . the following year , minton became a local commander of the american legion . the group had a large and active membership in the state at the time , and he used his position to encourage support of the democratic party agenda . paul mcnutt was the national commander , and the two men became political allies . when mcnutt became governor in <year> , he offered minton a position at the head of a new utility regulation commission . as commissioner , minton successfully imposed regulations that reduced state telephone bills by a combined total of $ 525,000 . the cuts received widespread media coverage , and minton was credited in the reports with the success . === senate campaign === becoming popular among the party leadership during his two years as commissioner , minton was encouraged by party leaders to run for the united states senate in <year> . at the state democratic party convention he ran against earl peters , a former chairman of the state party . with the support of mcnutt , minton won the nomination on the third ballot with <integer> votes to peters ' 586.minton launched a statewide campaign <days> august <year> and began delivering speeches in defense of the new deal . he blamed republicans for the conditions of the great depression . his opponent , incumbent republican senator arthur raymond robinson , accused minton of playing `` santa claus '' by trying to give everyone `` presents '' . he also criticized minton 's support of the new deal , which robinson and republicans called unconstitutional . minton 's initial campaign slogan was `` you ca n't offer a hungry man the constitution '' , a slogan he unveiled in a debate with robinson in corydon on august <days> . he continued using the slogan , and on september <days> , minton delivered his infamous `` you can not eat the constitution '' speech , in which he concluded the urgent needs of the masses outweighed the need to uphold the constitution . the speech backfired wildly and papers and opponents across the state called minton 's remarks traitorous . minton stopped using the slogan and explained his position again using new terms , but his opponents continued to dog him over the issue . the republicans also faulted popular governor mcnutt and his reorganization of the government , and mcnutt became more personally involved in the election . with the state party 's more direct involvement , minton won the election with <integer> percent of the vote . === lobby investigation committee === minton took his senate seat <days> january <year> . as a freshman , he sat in the back row of the chamber next to fellow freshman harry truman , and the pair quickly became friends . minton was made a member of a special lobby investigation committee chaired by senator hugo black , that was set up to look into questionable lobbyist groups . according to professor of political science linda c. gugin , a minton biographer , in practice the committee 's investigations were politically motivated and directed against groups that were challenging new deal legislation.william randolph hearst , a prominent and wealthy media magnate , began using his newspapers to deride the committee 's `` reckless attacks on freedom '' . minton led the effort to counter hearst and delivered a speech criticizing his support of the republican party . in <year> , senator black was appointed to the supreme court and left the senate , and minton secured his post as chair of the committee . minton immediately began a full-scale investigation of the media conglomerate controlled by frank e. gannett , accusing him of publishing republican party propaganda . for several weeks , minton delivered speeches against gannett in the senate , and gannett responded in kind in his newspapers . minton finally introduced legislation that would have made it `` illegal to publish information known to be false '' . gannett , and a large number of allies in newspapers and on radio , immediately began to charge minton and the democratic party with an assault on the freedom of the press . minton 's allies in congress asked him to withdraw the bill because of its political repercussions , and he dropped the matter.minton tried again to expose what he believed to be republican control of the media . he led the committee to target a newspaper with national circulation , rural progress . minton accused the publishers of improperly accepting large sums of money from corporations and the editors of undue influence from this money . the owner of the paper , maurive v. renolds , was summoned before the committee for a hearing , where minton demanded to know why he was accepting money from corporations . when renolds asked his manager , dr. glen frank , to help him answer the questions , minton and fellow democratic senators began to shout dr. frank down . as he was saying that the money from the corporations was for advertising in the magazine , minton beat his gavel and yelled , `` this committee does n't intend to permit you to use this as a forum to air your republican views . `` minton did not realize that frank was also president of the university of wisconsin , and soon suffered retaliation for the way he had treated frank . frank went on nbc radio stations around the country and lambasted minton for his rudeness . he made lengthy arguments accusing minton of attempting to violate the bill of rights . minton was outraged , but the arguments had an effect among voters in indiana . in <year> , he sought funding to launch a massive nationwide investigation of media conglomerates for proof of republican interference in the press . democratic senator edward r. burke led an effort to defeat the measure and privately accused minton of damaging the democrats ' cause , which led minton to leave the lobby investigation committee.minton was a fierce partisan during his time in the senate , and regularly abused his opponents verbally . democratic senator huey long became one of minton 's favorite targets because of long 's often-threatened filibusters . during one of the filibusters , long threatened to join the republican party . after most senators had left the chamber , minton remained for several hours to periodically taunt long . after tiring of the taunts , long launched a rebuttal from the podium , calling minton a vicious politician whose positions would cost minton re-election . the exchange was unusual for its tone and later made national news.minton was involved in many such exchanges , including a particularly fierce one with republican senator lester j. dickinson <days> march <year> . dickinson delivered a speech in the senate castigating president franklin d. roosevelt for carrying out what he termed illegal and unconstitutional acts . minton responded with a range of accusations , some personal , against dickinson and his `` political naivety '' . === court packing === in <year> , the united states supreme court ruled the agricultural adjustment act of <year> unconstitutional . for the first time , minton gave speeches criticizing the court for overriding the will of congress . he accused the court of allowing itself to be influenced by political motives rather than the law . in response to the court ruling , minton began drafting a bill which would allow the supreme court to declare a law unconstitutional only if seven out the nine justices supported the decision . <days> february <year> , before minton introduced his bill , president roosevelt introduced a plan of his own to deal with the supreme court . roosevelt proposed adding more justices to the court and creating a mandatory retirement age ; the changes would allow him to appoint an overwhelming majority to the court , more sympathetic to his agenda , ensuring the safety of legislation passed by his party.minton was pleased with roosevelt 's bill and quickly became its leading supporter in the senate . the measure was placed in an omnibus bill designed to reform judicial salaries and districting , among many other measures . republicans quickly discovered the court-packing provision and targeted the bill . democrats had overwhelming super-majorities in congress , and passage of the bill at first seemed assured . minton 's support of the bill helped him earn the position of senate majority whip , allowing him to more effectively push for its passage . minton delivered six radio addresses on behalf of his party in support of the bill , but public opinion could not be swayed in the democrats ' favor.minton received a death threat in the form of an envelope containing a shotgun shell and a message advising him to not vote for the court packing plan . many democrats , fearing their re-election prospects , joined with republicans and defeated the bill . minton was unhappy with the loss and it cost him considerable support among his voters , but as a result of his close connection with the bill and the leaders of his party , he gained more influence with the democrats.although minton supported the roosevelt administration and became a regular guest at the white house , minton opposed the president on some measures . he voted to override a presidential veto of a grant of $ 2.5 billion ( $ <integer> billion in <year> dollars ) in bonus pay for world war i soldiers ( bonus army ) . he supported the dyer anti-lynching bill , which roosevelt feared would cost the party support in the southern states . he also supported an extension of the hatch act of <year> , a law that prevented federal employees from being forced to take part in state election campaigns , effectively lessening the influence of federal patronage.as world war ii neared , minton took a cautious position on united states involvement . when the soviet union invaded finland , minton voted against granting a loan to finland to help finance its defense efforts . he also opposed selling munitions and weapons to the allies or the axis powers . he advocated and supported expanding the american military and believed that american entry into the war was inevitable , but should be delayed as long as possible . he voted in favor of the smith act , which made it a crime to advocate the overthrow of the government , a law specifically targeted at communists and fascists in the united states . in his final year in office , there was considerable speculation in the press that minton would be named to higher office by roosevelt , including cabinet positions and the supreme court , but neither happened . === re-election campaign === minton ran for re-election to his senate seat in <year> . mcnutt was challenging roosevelt for the presidential nomination , forcing minton to choose between the administration and his allies in the state party . minton sided with roosevelt , which cost him mcnutt 's and the indiana democratic party machine 's support in his re-election bid.the republican presidential candidate , wendell willkie was also a native of indiana , and minton faced a difficult challenge to win re-election . he referred to willkie as a `` sycophant for the rich and famous '' . willkie never responded to minton 's taunts , leaving minton 's opponent in the senate race , raymond e. willis , to do so in his stead . willis had run for the senate two years earlier but was defeated by democrat frederick van nuys . willis faulted minton on a range of topics but focused on the legislation minton supported while in the senate . willis claimed that much of the legislation was unconstitutional and minton 's positions were detrimental to the nation . minton responded by pointing out willis 's connections to wealthy corporations and accused him of not caring for the people . minton 's campaign focused on the achievements of the new deal programs . he claimed farm income in indiana had doubled since <year> , and highlighted the passage of the old age pension laws . his support for conscription and military preparedness for the coming war proved unpopular with voters and cost him considerable support , but according to historian william radcliff it was willkie 's favorite son status , which led many hoosiers to vote republican , that proved to be the election 's deciding factor . despite minton 's heavy campaigning , he lost the close election to willis by 5,179 votes out of over 1.5 million cast.roosevelt won the <year> presidential election . after minton left office <days> january <year> , he was given a position in the roosevelt administration as a reward for his loyalty during the court packing failure . he served as one of the president 's advisers and a liaison between the white house and congress . the extent of his duties is not fully known ; linda gugin has speculated that <days> may have managed roosevelt 's patronage system . minton was responsible for getting several officials appointed to high offices in the federal bureaucracy and numerous others appointed to lower ranking positions . he also convinced roosevelt to support the creation of a senate defense committee chaired by truman , a position that brought truman into the national spotlight and helped him gain the vice presidency . == seventh circuit == === appointment === on may <days> , <year> , roosevelt announced minton 's nomination to the chicago-based united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit . minton was confirmed unanimously by the senate on may <days> , <year> , and received his commission on may <days> , <year> . minton resigned from his post in the administration , but even after he began working on the court , minton remained active in democratic politics behind the scenes and was in regular correspondence with roosevelt to make patronage suggestions.minton took his oath of office on may <days> , <year> , but the court was in recess at the time . he took his seat when it returned to session on october <days> , <year> . the court had the highest court load of all the appellate courts in the nation at that time , averaging <integer> cases per judge annually . the men on the court were close friends , and minton developed a particularly close friendship with judge j. earl major ; major offered minton financial assistance during his later illnesses . major had been on the court for several years and held a judicial philosophy similar to minton 's . the two men regularly attended baseball games and were frequent guests in each other 's homes.world war ii broke out shortly after minton joined the court , creating a flood of cases in which legal precedent provided little guidance , including challenges to wartime measures , selective service laws , price controls , rationing and civil liberties . in the majority of these cases , the court affirmed the decisions of the district courts , but in several the court was required to establish a precedent . minton stated on several occasions his personal preference to affirm the decisions of the lower courts . he believed that the court that heard the case and pronounced judgment was generally able to make a decision that was superior to appellate courts ' decisions . he believed the appellate process should be reserved for the more serious cases and cases where the lower court had clearly made a mistake . === jurisprudence === minton was described by william radcliff as a `` faithful disciple of judicial restraint , '' an unexpected development when compared to his overtly partisan political career . radcliff attributed minton 's conservative position to the distaste he developed for the courts when they overturned legislation passed while he was in the senate . the courts ' actions led him to strongly believe in the limited exercise of judicial power when evaluating the constitutionality of governmental conduct . much of the recently passed new deal legislation was being tried in the courts for constitutionality and enforcement , putting minton in the uncommon position of adjudicating cases which depended on legislation he had helped write.during his time on the seventh circuit , minton authored <integer> of the court 's opinions , including twelve dissenting opinions . some of his opinions won praise ; the editors of tax magazine commented favorably on minton 's opinions on tax law , calling them `` direct hoosier logic '' . other court reporting papers made similar comments , applauding the manner in which he turned complex issues to simple questions that could easily be understood.in the cases of sunkist v. sunkist and quaker oats co. v. general mills , the court held that it was possible for different companies to use the same brand and product name as long as they produced dissimilar products . in another case , the court set a short-lived precedent allowing companies to artificially raise prices in local markets if the purpose was to artificially lower prices in another market to remain competitive . after minton joined the united states supreme court , the decision was appealed to that body ; minton recused himself from the case , which the court decided to overturn . in another decision , minton was in the majority that ruled under the sherman antitrust act that the new york great atlantic and pacific tea company was a monopoly , ordering the company to break up its grocery business . minton was also in the majority in several cases filed to enforce decisions made by the national labor relations board , usually to end worker strikes.in the case of united states v. knauer , the government denied the wife of a united states citizen entry into the country because of her possible ties to nazism . in a much-criticized majority opinion which minton co-authored with judge major , he stated that the `` alien did not have any legal right— [ her ] status was a political decision to be made by officials in government . '' many liberals condemned the court at the time of the decision . the ruling was upheld by the supreme court in a <year> appeal.one of minton 's favorite cases was that of modernistic candies , inc. v. federal trade commission . the candy company produced a one-cent gumball dispenser in which almost all the gumballs were the same color . a few different-colored gumballs were included which , when dispensed , entitled the purchaser to a prize from the merchant who owned the machine . the ftc had an injunction put in place barring the company from producing the machines because they claimed it violated anti-gambling laws . minton wrote the majority opinion and sided with the majority to keep the injunction in place , but dryly mocked the counsel for the defense and the gambling law , stating : counsel for the petitioner discussed at great length from a sociological point of view , of the age-old problem of the gambling instinct in the human being . according to his analysis , gambling pervades our entire economic system ; thus insurance contracts are a gamble , stock and grain exchange transactions are gambles , and the farmer 's dependence on weather is a gamble . counsel 's attempt to apply this analysis to the present case left us cold and unimpressed . he even reminded us that our great idol , mr. chief justice john marshall , in his day attended the horse races and wagered with his clergyman . in fact , they ran a book . as indicating how times have changed and how even our coarse nature has yielded to the protecting care of governmental policy , we confess we do not even know a bookmaker , clerical or otherwise , and our passes to the beautiful race tracks around chicago lie in our desk unused . minton often lamented that he was required to `` pronounce the law as it was written , but on no occasion [ c ] ould he make the law . '' === clemency board and failing health === after roosevelt 's death and truman 's succession to the presidency , minton continued offering advice to the new administration on a range of topics , including patronage and political maneuvering . truman appointed minton as head of the war department clemency board , a panel of judges charged with overseeing reviews of decisions made by the courts-martial . the panel met every two weeks which , along with his responsibilities on the circuit court , kept minton very busy and afforded him little rest , leading to a deterioration in his health . while yachting with president truman on memorial day in <year> , truman asked minton to accept an appointment to the position of solicitor general of the united states . minton declined because of his health , but he told truman he would be interested in a seat on the supreme court.in september <year> , minton suffered a heart attack while in washington ; he was hospitalized for three months at walter reed hospital . after returning to work , he was forced to rest regularly due to gradually worsening anemia , and he sought to lessen his workload . to further complicate his health , on august <days> , <year> , minton tripped over a stone in his yard and broke his leg . the injury forced him to walk with a cane for the remainder of his life . == supreme court == === nomination and confirmation === at a september <days> , <year> , news conference , truman announced minton 's nomination to the supreme court , succeeding the late justice wiley rutledge . minton had already privately accepted the nomination several days earlier after a telephone conversation with truman . truman touted minton 's extensive law education and his years of experience on the circuit courts as the reason for his nomination . news of minton 's appointment received mixed reviews nationally . the new york times said that truman had allowed personal and political friendship to influence his choice . the new republic said `` the president is again reverting to his deplorable habit of choosing men for high post because they happen to be his friends .... '' the washington post raised questions about minton 's ability to be confirmed by the senate due to the power many of his foes held in the body . the indianapolis star offered a more sympathetic opinion , pointing out minton 's qualifications and the pride indiana could take in having a native on the supreme court . the article noted that he would be the most educated justice on the court , should he be confirmed.indiana senator william e. jenner led opponents of minton 's nomination , including some of minton 's old foes , in an attempt to bring him before the body for hearings . minton wrote a letter to the senate judicial committee answering several of their questions , but refused to submit himself to a hearing . he mentioned his broken leg and hinted in his letter that it could be detrimental to his health to travel in his condition . he also stated that , as a sitting judge and former member of the senate , it would be improper for him submit to a hearing . although hearings had occurred irregularly in the past , it was not customary at that time to have a hearing on a nominee . during an absence of jenner 's , minton 's allies worked to have the hearing request dropped and the judicial committee sent the measure to the full senate in a vote of <integer> to <integer> . senator homer s. ferguson attempted to have the nomination returned to committee but the motion failed , 45–21 . the long debate over minton 's appointment focused on his partisanship , support of the court packing plan during his time in the senate , and poor health . his opponents launched numerous delaying tactics ; the senate session before the vote to confirm minton lasted until midnight . his confirmation was approved 48–16 on october <days> , <year> and he received his commission on october <days> , <year> . to date , minton remains the last member of congress , sitting or former , to be appointed to the united states supreme court , and he is the only native of indiana to be appointed to the court . === judicial restraint === minton 's central judicial philosophy was to ascertain and uphold the original intent of legislation . he continued to take a broad view of governmental powers , demonstrated in his dissenting vote in the case of youngstown sheet & tube co. v. sawyer , which ruled unconstitutional president truman 's wartime seizure of several steel mills to avert a workers ' strike . of all the cases in which minton was involved , he disagreed most with the youngstown decision and `` went into a tirade '' during the conference where the decision was made . he argued that there `` could be no vacant spot in power when the security of the nation is at stake . '' despite his strong protest , he could not influence the court to permit the president to seize the plants without congressional approval . minton joined with chief justice fred m. vinson and justice stanley forman reed in the dissenting opinion that the president had the authority through the war powers clause of the constitution . minton abhorred racial segregation and provided a solid vote to strike down the school segregation practices at issue in <year> 's landmark case of brown v. board of education ; it was among the few decisions in which he sided against the government . according to william radcliff , the majority opinion authored by minton in the <year> case barrows v. jackson was his most skillfully written opinion . he framed the complex question of the case as : `` can a racially restrictive covenant be enforced at law by a suit for damages against a co-covenantor who allegedly broke the covenant ? '' the court decided the answer in the negative.in the area of civil liberties , minton adhered to the doctrine of `` fundamental fairness '' , a test established by the supreme court in <year> . in one decision , minton stated that the right of free speech was not an absolute right , and could be regulated so as not to violate the rights of others . in united states v. rabinowitz , minton wrote the court 's opinion upholding a lower court ruling which allowed police to search automobiles without a warrant , provided there was probable cause to justify the search.minton voted to uphold anticommunist legislation during the period of the `` red scare '' , siding with the majority in <year> 's dennis v. united states , which upheld the conviction of the leader of the us communist party . during the same period , the court was split over the legality of governmental loyalty tests . many agencies had programs in place to ensure that members of the government were not communists . minton 's vote proved to be the deciding factor in cases regarding loyalty tests . in the case of bailey v. richardson , minton 's vote upheld the legality of the loyalty tests , while in the decision he authored in the case of joint anti-fascist refugee committee v. mcgrath , he voted to uphold the plaintiff 's position that he had been terminated illegally because of his support of fascist ideology . minton 's position gradually shifted to allowing the loyalty tests to take place , and in adler v. board of ed . of city of new york he wrote the majority opinion allowing the tests and upholding new york 's feinberg law . this proved to be the most important vote as it allowed the tests to be given with only minimal suspicion of a person 's disloyalty to the government.because of minton 's previous congressional partisanship , many liberals believed he would support their positions when on the court . throughout his tenure , minton regularly disappointed them , leading many to rail against him . a lawyer writing for the new jersey law journal labeled minton a `` spokesman against freedom '' , calling him `` a man of conspicuous judicial shortcomings , whose votes against civil liberties exceeded those of any other man on the court , and who wrote comparatively few opinions of other kinds . '' linda gugin pointed out that minton was a disappointment to liberals because he consistently chose order over freedom . gugin also concludes that minton had the strongest commitment to judicial restraint and ideological neutrality of any justice , past or present . === politics === although minton was on the supreme court , he remained casually involved in democratic internal politics . he wrote truman several letters criticizing justices robert h. jackson and hugo black , referring to black as a demagogue . he also offered advice on dealing with republican opposition in the senate . in a <year> letter , after truman left office , he urged truman to help focus public attention on the economy and away from communism , a threat he claimed the republicans were exaggerating to avoid confronting their own problems.after truman 's withdrawal from the <year> presidential campaign , minton made remarks indicating he had advised truman to stay out of the contested new hampshire primary election to begin with . <days> august <year> , a reporter asked minton about his preferred candidate in the upcoming presidential election . minton answered , `` i have great confidence in adlai stevenson . '' he also remarked that dwight d. eisenhower was politically handicapped . minton was lambasted in the media for his endorsement , which he attempted to retract a few days later after being advised to do so by other members of the court . === regular dissenter === truman 's other appointees to the court provided consistent conservative votes , and during minton 's first years on the court it was returned to the conservatism of the william howard taft era . while on the court , minton transformed from a new deal senator into an almost reactionary judge as an ally of justice felix frankfurter . empirical coding of votes shows that minton was the most conservative justice on the court during his first year , and remained in the conservative half of the court for the duration of his career.minton did not enjoy the limited influence of his judicial role in the later years of his term , when he was more frequently in the minority in voting on cases . after the deaths of chief justice fred m. vinson and justice robert jackson , minton found himself with little support for many of his opinions , which led him to begin considering retirement.the shifting position of the court led to personal animosity between members of its two wings . despite his disappointment over the court 's positions on some issues , minton remained popular among his colleagues on the court as he did n't take sides in their personal disagreements ; he proved a soothing presence during a period marked by bitter personal feuds between strong personalities such as william o. douglas and felix frankfurter.minton informed eisenhower of his intention to retire in a letter on september <days> , <year> , in which he dryly stated his retirement was authorized by law . eisenhower responded with a brief note wishing him a happy retirement . although he did not tell the president , minton informed the members of the court that his duties were too taxing on his health . his anemia had steadily worsened , slowing him physically and mentally . minton served as a justice until october <days> , <year> , retiring after <integer> years and <integer> days of service . he was succeeded by william j. brennan jr. == later life == === retirement === announcing his departure , minton remarked , `` there will be more interest in who will succeed me than in my passing . i 'm an echo . '' despite the health difficulties , minton regretted his decision almost immediately.minton returned to his new albany home , where he took a much lighter workload . he gave occasional lectures at indiana university and continued to give public speeches from time to time . for several years after retiring from the supreme court , minton occasionally accepted assignments to serve temporarily on one of the lower federal courts . he received an honorary doctorate degree from the university of louisville . he took many trips around the united states , and two trips to europe . in england , he received an honorary doctorate from oxford university in 1956.despite his failing health , minton remained active in the democratic party . he was most concerned with president eisenhower , who he believed was incompetent . he remained in regular correspondence with truman , and the two met on several occasions at democratic party functions . === death and legacy === in late march <year> , minton was admitted to floyd memorial hospital in new albany , where it was found he was suffering internal bleeding . he died in his sleep early in the morning of april <days> . minton 's wife was roman catholic ; his funeral was held at the now-defunct holy trinity catholic church and was attended by many dignitaries , including several sitting members of the supreme court , the governors of indiana and kentucky , and several members of congress . he was buried in the holy trinity cemetery , on green valley road in new albany , next to leo receveur . minton himself was nominally catholic and had shunned christianity for most of his life ; he only began to occasionally attend mass following his retirement . he left most of his personal papers and judicial records to the truman presidential library.minton is the eponym of the sherman minton bridge , which carries interstate <integer> across the ohio river , connecting western louisville , kentucky with new albany , indiana . minton attended the dedication of the bridge at a <year> ceremony . he is also the namesake of the annual sherman minton moot court competition , held at the indiana university maurer school of law . he is also honored ( with indiana senator homer e. capehart ) —in the `` brutalist '' style designed by woollen , molzan and partners and with architectural art by milton glaser—in the centrally located minton-capehart federal building on indiana world war memorial plaza in indianapolis . a bronze bust of minton was created and put on display in the indiana statehouse.while some writers like linda gugin and legal historian william radcliff have given high praise to minton 's logic in his written opinions , they point out that his positions had little long-term impact . other legal historians , like bernard schwartz , have a more negative opinion of minton 's judicial career . schwartz wrote that minton `` was below mediocrity as a justice . his opinions , relatively few for his tenure , are less than third rate , characterized by their cavalier approach to complicated issues . '' schwartz went on to say , `` he ranks near the bottom of any list of justices . '' most of the precedents minton helped establish were overturned by the warren court in the years immediately following his retirement . in total he wrote sixty-seven majority opinions along with several of the dissenting opinions . gugin authored a work in rebuttal to schwartz 's harsh critique , saying that minton 's rulings were `` predictable based on the principles of deference , precedent , and strict interpretation '' ; she attributed his poor ranking to the bias of reviewers in favor of judicial activism.minton 's time on the court marked the end of a transitory period in the judiciary . since minton , justices have tended to serve increasingly longer terms on the court , which has had strong political science implications on the supreme court . the growing concept of judicial non-partisanship became the norm in american politics after minton—he was the last member of congress to be appointed to the court . linda gugin and professor james st. clair have noted that the federal courts have lost a valuable point of view by not having experienced legislators among their ranks.minton played an important role behind the scenes of the court as a peacemaker between its two opposing factions . these attempts to keep the peace led justice frankfurter to remark that while minton would never be remembered as a great justice , he would be remembered as a great colleague by his fellow justices . == electoral history == == see also == demographics of the supreme court of the united states list of justices of the supreme court of the united states list of united states

treasury coincided with some of the most critical years in the history of contemporary italy . andreatta sanctioned the separation of the bank of italy by the italian ministry of the treasury , and when in <year> the p2 the scandal was revealed , he was adamant in removing officials and managers who appeared in the list seized from licio gelli . with the onset of the scandal of the ior of

economist and the recipient of the <year> nobel memorial prize in economics . he was a professor at university of illinois at urbana–champaign , carnegie mellon university , and mit sloan school of management . == early life and education == modigliani was born on <integer> june <year> in rome , lazio , italy , to the jewish family of a pediatrician father and a voluntary social worker mother.he entered university at the age of seventeen , enrolling in the faculty of law at the sapienza university of rome . in his second year at sapienza , his submission to a nationwide contest in economics sponsored by the official student organization of the state , won first prize and modigliani received an award from the hand of benito mussolini . he wrote several essays for the fascist magazine `` the state '' , where he showed an inclination for the fascist ideological currents critical of liberalism . among his early works in fascist italy was an article about the organization and management of production in a socialist economy , written in italian and arguing the case for socialism along lines laid out by earlier market socialists like abba lerner and oskar lange.but , that early enthusiasm evaporated soon after the passage of racial laws in italy . in <year> , modigliani left italy for paris together with his then-girlfriend , serena calabi , to join her parents there . after briefly returning to rome to discuss his laurea thesis at the city 's university , he obtained his diploma on <integer> july <year> , and returned to paris.the same year , they all emigrated to the united states and he enrolled at the graduate faculty of the new school for social research . his ph.d. dissertation , an elaboration and extension of john hicks ' is–lm model , was written under the supervision of jacob marschak and abba lerner , in <year> , and is considered `` ground breaking . '' == career == from <year> to <year> , modigliani taught at columbia university and bard college as an instructor in economics and statistics . in <year> , he became a naturalized citizen of the united states . in <year> , he joined the university of illinois at urbana–champaign faculty . from <year> to <year> , he was a member of the carnegie mellon university faculty.in <year> , he joined the faculty of mit , as an institute professor . == contributions to economic theory == modigliani , beginning in the 1950s , was an originator of the life-cycle hypothesis , which attempts to explain the level of saving in the economy . the hypothesis that consumers aim for a stable level of consumption throughout their lifetime ( for example by saving during their working years and then spending during their retirement ) . the rational expectations hypothesis is considered by economists to originate in the paper written by modigliani and emile grunberg in 1954.when he was a member of the carnegie mellon university faculty , he formulated in <year> , along with merton miller , the modigliani–miller theorem for corporate finance . the theorem posits that , under certain assumptions , the value of a firm is not affected by whether it is financed by equity ( selling shares ) or by debt ( borrowing money ) , meaning that the debt-to-equity ratio is unimportant for private firms.in the early 1960s , his response , co-authored with albert ando , to the <year> paper of milton friedman and david i. meiselman , initiated the so-called `` monetary/fiscal policy debate '' among economists , which went on for more than sixty years.in <year> , modigliani , in a paper whose co-author was his former student lucas papademos , introduced the concept of the `` niru '' , the non-inflationary rate of unemployment , ostensibly an improvement over the `` natural rate of unemployment '' concept . the terms refer to a level of unemployment below which inflation rises.in <year> , modigliani and his granddaughter , leah modigliani , developed what is now called the `` modigliani risk-adjusted performance , '' a measure of the risk-adjusted returns of an investment portfolio that was derived from the sharpe ratio , adjusted for the risk of the portfolio relative to that of a benchmark , e.g . the `` market . '' == appointments and awards == <days> october <year> , modigliani was awarded the nobel prize in economics `` for his pioneering analyses of saving and of financial markets . `` in <year> , modigliani received mit 's james r. killian faculty achievement award . in <year> , he received an honoris causa degree in management engineering from the university of naples federico ii in <year> . late in his life , modigliani became a trustee of the economists for peace and security organization , formerly `` economists allied for arms reduction '' and was considered an `` influential adviser '' : in the late 1960s , on a contract with the federal reserve , he designed the `` mit-pennsylvania-social science research council '' model , a tool that `` guided monetary policy in washington for many decades . `` a collection of modigliani 's papers is housed at duke university 's rubenstein library . == criticism == modigliani 's work on fiscal policy came under criticism from followers of post-keynesian economics , who disputed the `` keynesianism '' of his viewpoints , pointing out his contribution to the nairu concept , as well as his general stance on fiscal deficits . the modigliani-miller theorem implies that , for a closed economy , state borrowing is merely deferred taxation , since state spending can be financed only by `` printing money '' , taxation , or borrowing , and therefore monetary financing of state spending implies the subsequent imposition of a so-called `` inflation tax , '' which ostensibly has the same effect on permanent income as explicit taxation.nonetheless , they acknowledged his dissenting voice on the issue of unemployment , in which modigliani concurred early on with heterodox economists that europe-wide unemployment in the late 20th century was caused by the lack of demand induced by austerity policies . == personal life == in <year> , while they were in paris , modigliani married serena calabi . they had two children , andre and sergio modigliani . modigliani died in cambridge , massachusetts , in <year> , while still working at mit , and teaching until the last months of his life . he was <integer> . serena modigliani-calabi , active to the end in progressive politics , most notably with the league of women voters , and an outspoken believer in participatory democracy , died in <year> . == selected bibliography == === books === modigliani , franco ; abel , andrew b. ; johnson , simon ( <year> ) . the collected papers of franco modigliani . cambridge , massachusetts : mit press . isbn <days> . modigliani , franco ; fabozzi , frank j .

from a young age ; moore published his first academic article in the auk at age <integer> . in the early 1930s moore 's mother divorced again and took the family to washington d.c. and then to new york city . moore finished his last two years of high school at haaren high school . he also volunteered at the american museum of natural history . despite his humble background he was accepted to columbia college as an undergraduate after a strong interview . while there , he married fellow embryology graduate student betty clark in <year> . both had studied under lester barth . it was likely moore 's suggestion in the 1930s that influenced lester sharp and franz schrader to coin the term kinetochore , which refers to a genetic structure key to chromosome congression during metazoan mitosis . == career == from <year> to <year> moore tutored biology at brooklyn college and from <year> to <year> he taught biology at queens college . in <year> moore was hired by barnard college to

spent a year in australia using cross-fertilization to study frog speciation . the resulting monograph , published in <year> , described <integer> frog species . an illustration of one of the frogs discussed in moore 's monograph , the corroboree frog , was featured on an australian postage stamp . no longer a department chair , moore continued teaching at columbia until <year> when he was hired by university of california , riverside ( ucr ) . although moore reached mandatory retirement age in <year> , ucr allowed moore to keep his office and continue to teach until his death in 2002.since

stresemann . he decided that birds were more interesting than law and after graduating from yale in <year> he was advised by ernst mayr that `` the most important thing you can do is get a sound and broad biological training . '' he then enrolled at columbia university . and he began studying zoology at columbia university . as a part of his study , ripley participated in the denison-crockett expedition to new guinea in <other> and the vanderbilt expedition to sumatra in <year> . he later obtained a ph.d. in zoology from harvard university in <year> . === war service and academic work === during world war ii , he served under william j. donovan ( `` coordinator of information '' ) in the office of strategic services , the predecessor of the central intelligence agency . in the early days ripley acted as liaison with the british security coordination led by sir william stephenson at the rockefeller center . he later was in charge of american intelligence services in southeast asia . others who joined the oss early included ripley 's yale friends sherman kent and wilmarth s. lewis . ripley held a high regard for his oss colleagues and considered it unfair on the part of some to decry those who were socially inclined leading to some calling the organization as `` oh so social '' . ripley trained many indonesian spies , all of whom were killed during the war . he was posted briefly to australia with the identity of a lieutenant colonel in case he was captured . he was to go through england , egypt , china and then on to india and ceylon . he then worked with detachment <integer> in bangkok , working to recover allied airmen who had been captured in the region with the help of friendly thais who worked to keep them under cover from the japanese forces . after this period he moved to sri lanka and never got to australia as originally planned . he worked with and `` cultivated '' lord mountbatten throughout this period . the two often met at dinners and parties both in new delhi and at trincomalee . on one occasion , ripley noticed a green woodpecker and went off to shoot it while dressed only in a towel . the specimen label reads `` shot at cocktail party ... towel fell off . '' it was in kandy , sri lanka that he met his future wife mary livingston and her roommate julia child ( then julia mcwilliams ) both working with the oss . the anthropologist gregory bateson was also here and he would introduce julia to paul child , her future husband . an article in the august <days> , <year> new yorker said that ripley reversed the usual pattern , where spies posed as ornithologists in order to gain access to sensitive areas , and instead used his position as an intelligence officer to go birding in restricted areas . the government of thailand awarded him the order of the white elephant , a national award for his support of the thai underground during the war . in <year> , ripley entered nepal pretending to be a close confidante of jawaharlal nehru and the nepal government , eager to maintain diplomatic ties with its newly independent neighbour , allowed him and edward migdalski to collect bird specimens . nehru came to hear of this from an article in the new yorker and was furious , leading to a difficult time for his collaborator and coauthor , salim ali . salim ali came to hear of nehru 's displeasure through horace alexander and the matter was forgiven after some effort . the oss past however led to a growing suspicion that american scientists working in india were cia agents . david challinor , a former smithsonian administrator , noted that there were many cia agents in india , with some posing as scientists . he noted that the smithsonian sent a scholar to india for anthropological research who unknown to them was interviewing tibetan refugees from chinese-occupied tibet but went on to say that there was no evidence that ripley worked for the cia after he left the oss in 1945.he joined the american ornithologists ' union in <year> , became an elective member in <year> , and a fellow in <year> . after the war he taught at yale and was a fulbright fellow in <year> and a guggenheim fellow in <year> . at yale , one of the key scientific influences on ripley was the ecologist g. evelyn hutchinson , who had led the yale expedition to india in <year> . ripley became a full professor and director of the peabody museum of natural history . ripley served for many years on the board of the world wildlife fund in the u.s. , and was the third president of the international council for bird preservation ( icbp , now birdlife international ) . === smithsonian institution === he served as secretary of the smithsonian institution from <year> to <year> . he set out to reinvigorate and expand the smithsonian , building new museums , including the anacostia neighborhood museum , now the anacostia community museum , cooper-hewitt , national design museum , hirshhorn museum and sculpture garden , renwick gallery , national air and space museum , national museum of african art , enid a. haupt garden , the underground quadrangle complex known as the s. dillon ripley center , and the arthur m. sackler gallery.in <year> , he helped found the smithsonian folklife festival , and in <year> , he helped found smithsonian magazine . he believed that <integer> % to <integer> % of then-living animal species would become extinct in the next <integer> years.in <year> he was awarded the presidential medal of freedom , the highest civilian award of the united states . he was awarded honorary degrees from <integer> colleges and universities , including brown , yale , johns hopkins , harvard , and cambridge . ripley successfully defended the national museum of natural history against a lawsuit that objected to the dynamics of evolution exhibit . == legacy == ripley had intended to produce a definitive guide to the birds of south asia , but became too ill to play an active part in its realisation . however , the eventual authors , his assistant , pamela c. rasmussen , and artist john c. anderton , named the final two-volume guide as birds of south asia . the ripley guide in his honor . the smithsonian 's underground complex on the national mall , the s. dillon ripley center , is named in his honor . a garden between the hirshhorn museum and sculpture garden and the arts and industries building was dedicated in <year> to his wife , mary livingston ripley . the first-ever full-length biography of ripley , the lives of dillon ripley : natural scientist , wartime spy , and pioneering leader of the smithsonian institution by roger d. stone , was published in <year> . the livingston ripley waterfowl conservancy , a non-profit zoo dedicated to breeding endangered waterfowl , is located on <other> of the ripley estate in litchfield , connecticut . the zoo 's history began in the 1920s when ripley began keeping and breeding waterfowl as a teenager , and he is credited with the first captive breedings of red-breasted goose , nene , emperor goose , and laysan teal as well as the first us captive breedings of new zealand scaup , greenland mallard ( a. p. conboschas ) , and philippine duck . in <year> , dillon and his wife , mary livingston ripley , donated the chunk of their estate that is today the zoo to the non-profit organization that continues to operate it . today

'' at the age of <integer> , he earned the government scholarship to attend the london school of economics ( lse ) , becoming the first black individual to gain acceptance there . while enrolled to study for a bachelor of commerce degree ( `` which offered accounting , business management , commercial law and a little economics and statistics '' ) in <year> , he would achieve similar success as he did at grade school . lewis 's academic superiority was noticed and admired by his peers and professors . while at lse , he had the opportunity to study under the likes of john hicks , arnold plant , lionel robbins , and friedrich hayek . after lewis graduated in <year> with first-class honours , lse gave him a scholarship to read for a phd in industrial economics , under the supervision of arnold plant . lewis would become the first black faculty member at lse : in <year> he was given a teaching appointment , and in <year> was made an assistant lecturer , continuing to work as a member of the lse staff until 1948.in <year> , lewis married gladys jacobs , and that year he was selected as a lecturer at the victoria university of manchester , and moved there with his family , becoming britain 's first black lecturer . in <year> , at the age of <integer> , he was made a full professor . he taught at manchester until <year> . during this period , he developed some of his most important concepts about the patterns of capital and wages in developing countries . he particularly became known for his contributions to development economics , of great interest as former colonies began to gain independence from their european colonizers.lewis served as an economic advisor to numerous african and caribbean governments , including nigeria , ghana , trinidad and tobago , jamaica , and barbados . when ghana ( where in <year> his eldest brother stanley had settled ) gained independence in <year> , lewis was appointed as the country 's first economic advisor . he helped draw up its first five-year development plan ( 1959–1963 ) .in <year> lewis returned to the caribbean region when appointed vice chancellor of the university of the west indies . in <year> he was knighted by the british government for his achievements and for his contributions to economics . that year , he was also appointed professor of public and international affairs at princeton university – the first black instructor to be given a full professorship – and subsequently held the position of james madison professor of political economics . he also served from <year> to <year> he served as chancellor of the university of guyana . lewis worked at princeton for the next two decades , teaching generations of students until his retirement in <year> . lewis helped to establish / the caribbean development bank and in <year> he was selected as its first president , serving in that capacity until 1973.lewis received the nobel prize in economics in <year> , sharing it with theodore schultz , `` for their pioneering research into economic development research with particular consideration of the problems of developing countries '' .lewis died on <integer> june <year> in bridgetown , barbados . he was buried in the grounds of the st. lucian community college named in his honour . == personal life == in <year> , lewis married grenada-born gladys jacobs , with whom he had two daughters , elizabeth and barbara . == key works == === labour in the west indies : the birth of a workers ' movement ( <year> ) === labour in the west indies : the birth of a worker 's movement , first published by the fabian society in <year> , was an account of the 1930s labour movement in the caribbean . it remained the only work published on the caribbean-wide movement and the labour rebellions in the english-speaking caribbean for decades . the book was republished by john la rose and sarah white at new beacon books <days> february <year> . lewis is now characterised as `` among the earliest proponents of reparations for the former west indies for britain 's colonial wrongs '' because of the ideas he put forward in this work . === the `` lewis model '' === lewis published in <year> what was to be his most influential development economics article , `` economic development with unlimited supplies of labour '' ( manchester school ) . in this publication , he introduced what came to be called the dual sector model , or the `` lewis model '' .lewis combined an analysis of the historical experience of developed countries with the central ideas of the classical economists to produce a broad picture of the development process . in his theory , a `` capitalist '' sector develops by taking labour from a non-capitalist backward `` subsistence '' sector . the subsistence sector is governed by informal institutions and social norms so that producers do not maximize profits and workers can be paid above their marginal product . at an early stage of development , the `` unlimited '' supply of labour from the subsistence economy means that the capitalist sector can expand for some time without the need to raise wages . this results in higher returns to capital , which are reinvested in capital accumulation . in turn , the increase in the capital stock leads the `` capitalists '' to expand employment by drawing further labour from the subsistence sector . given the assumptions of the model ( for example , that the profits are reinvested and that capital accumulation does not substitute for skilled labour in production ) , the process becomes self-sustaining and leads to modernization and economic development.the point at which the excess labour in the subsistence sector is fully absorbed into the modern sector , and where further capital accumulation begins to increase wages , is sometimes called the lewisian turning point . it has recently been widely discussed in the context of economic development in china . === the theory of economic growth ( <year> ) === in his <year> book , the theory of economic growth , lewis sought to `` provide an appropriate framework for studying economic development '' , driven by a combination of `` curiosity and of practical need . `` during the industrial revolution , england was experiencing the worst economic turmoil of its time . it would not be until an economic enlightenment took place that cities began to shift towards factories and labour-intensive methods of production as they experienced giant shifts in the labour and agriculture markets , thus , eventually leading to higher production , and higher income . lewis theorized if england could turn its misfortune around , the same could be done for developing countries around the world . his theories proved true for some countries such as nigeria and barbados , as they would see some economic development . == selected bibliography == labour in the west indies : the birth of a workers ' movement ( <year> ) the principles of economic planning (

center.he worked for the national advisory committee for aeronautics ( naca ) from <year> to <year> and its successor nasa , until his retirement in <year> . he was involved with early research into supersonic flight and rocket-powered aircraft , and then with the united states manned space program , including the mercury , gemini , and apollo programs . == biography == === early life === gilruth was born october <days> , <year> , in nashwauk , minnesota , and moved to duluth when he was nine years old . he graduated in <year> from duluth central high school . as a teenager , gilruth was fascinated by aeronautics and spent time building model airplanes . he was inspired to pursue a career in the field after reading about naca ’ s langley memorial aeronautical laboratory in virginia . gilruth received a bachelor of science degree in aeronautical engineering at the university of minnesota in <year> , and received his master of science degree in <year> . while there he was a member of the professional engineering fraternity theta tau , of which he was later inducted as a hall of fame alumnus . === flight test career === <days> january <year> gilruth was hired at naca ’ s langley memorial aeronautical laboratory , where he performed flight research . his research led to the naca report r755 , requirements for satisfactory flying qualities of an airplane , published in <year> , in which he defined a set of requirements for the handling characteristics of an aircraft . until this point , no set of guidelines for pilots and aircraft designers existed.gilruth also pioneered the recording of data from instruments during flight test , to be later correlated with the pilot 's experience . this would go on to become the standard operating procedure . === nasa career === gilruth had been working on hypersonic missile rockets as the assistant director of the pilotless aircraft research division of naca . he and his team pushed their superiors to pursue a program to launch satellites into space , but he was rebuffed by administrators . the dynamic quickly changed after the soviets succeeded in launching sputnik , and gilruth became involved in the transition of naca into nasa.when nasa was created , gilruth became head of the space task group , tasked with putting a man in space before the soviet union.in <year> , when president john f. kennedy announced that america would put a man on the moon before the end of the decade ( the 1960s ) , gilruth was `` aghast '' and unsure that such a goal could be accomplished . he was integral to the creation of the gemini program , which he advocated as a means for nasa to learn more about operating in space before attempting a lunar landing.soon the apollo program was born , and gilruth was made head of the nasa center which ran it , the new manned spacecraft center ( msc ) ( now the johnson space center ) . gilruth was inducted into the national space hall of fame in <year> and served as director of the msc until his retirement in <year> . he was inducted as a member of the inaugural class to the international space hall of fame in <year> . he oversaw a total of <integer> manned space flights , from

was a taiwanese economist and politician best known as the `` father of taiwan 's economic miracle '' and referred to by the new york times as the `` godfather of technology '' in taiwan for his work in transforming taiwan 's economy from an agrarian-based system into one of the world 's leading producers of information and telecommunications technology . == biography == li was born in nanjing , qing china , on january <days> , <year> and died at the national taiwan university hospital in taipei , taiwan on may <days> , 2001.he graduated from national central university ( nanjing university ) in <year> and studied physics at the cambridge university in <year> . he returned to mainland china and spent many of his years in politics and economics before he fled from the chinese communist party to taiwan <days> july <year> with the nationalist party . he became the president of the taiwan shipbuilding corporation in <year> and was appointed as a member of the industrial development commission responsible for the planning and economic development of taiwan in <year> . in <year> he became the head of the industrial development and investment center under the council for united states aid.he held a number of leadership positions in industry and government in taiwan , including that of economic minister from <year> to <year> and finance minister from <year> to <year> . after <year> he was appointed `` minister without portfolio '' and promoted science and technology in taiwan . in <year> , he received the ramon magsaysay award for government service . he created a policy that helped attract entrepreneurs in the tech industry and helped fund taiwan 's electronics companies , which led to taiwan 's primacy as a producer of computer parts . li also helped build the hsinchu science park , which later became known as taiwan 's silicon valley . the park is one of the world 's leading centers for semiconductor manufacturing and industrial and computer technology development . as of <year> more than <integer> high-tech companies reside in the park . li was also a senior adviser to the president of the republic of china , chen shui-bian . == economic policy == in total , li was a government official for <integer> years , <integer> of which he spent in mainland china before the chinese communist party won the civil war . tony fu-lai yu speculates that the time li spent in mainland china , as well as his science-based university education , greatly influenced his policy-making in taiwan . li had no formal training in economics , thus most of his knowledge of economic management was gained from practical experience and working with other economists . consequently , yu argues his policy was insulated from popular economic ideology and instead was driven by pragmatism . li himself also claims that the purpose of his writings is to reveal his policy-making experiences for the future reference of other developing countries , and did not engage in writing about economic , administrative , or political science theory.yu argues that li 's policy-making can be explained by evolutionary economics . two yale economists , gustav ranis and john c.h . fei , wrote the introductory essays to li 's <year> book the evolution of policy behind taiwan 's development success . therefore , it can be interpreted that ranis and fei 's views on economic policy are representative of li's.ranis mainly writes on neo-classical growth theory , which claims that a steady economic growth rate can be achieved by correctly balancing the driving forces of labor , capital , and technology . he also writes on the concept of agricultural labor surplus economies which , in freeing up workers and generating agricultural surplus and leading to increased productivity in expanding commercial sectors.fei argues that two main types of forces govern policy evolution : objective and subjective . objective forces are predetermined conditions , encompassing physical environments , external economic conditions , etc . subjective forces include personal beliefs , economic knowledge , memories , experiences , and `` common sense . '' fei believes that political beliefs and ideology are the strongest factors in shaping economic policy-making , and thus is an ongoing process . in following with the concept of evolutionary economics , fei believes that economic policy must change to suit new and ever-changing situations . therefore , policy should not be static when created and instead evolve and be improved on to adapt to new situations . li himself claims that the liberalization of the taiwanese economy was a gradual process rather than an abrupt one following the international fad of free market ideology in the 1960s and 1970s . === pragmatic economics === li argues that there are two types of issues central to analyzing policy evolution . first is the economic impact of a policy , second is causation , or why a certain policy appears and is implemented at a certain time . li believes pragmatism should supersede ideology in terms of policy-making : [ policy innovation should be based on ] the anticipation of impending problems and conflicts , rather than be purely ideologically motivated . . . the very notion of an evolution of policy suggests that the timing ( or timely appearance ) of a particular policy is important , and a good policy innovation is one that does not arrive prematurely . ideological considerations often get in the way of appropriate timing as , for example , with so-called welfare state legislation that the economy simply can not support . what can almost be called a rejection of ideology lies at the heart of a healthy pragmatism that has guided policymakers in taiwan and has supported a social consensus for growth and economic liberalization.he argues against ideology-based policy making because it often interferes with the timing of certain policies , and all too often change too quickly . he believes such policy is “ motivated by goals considered larger than people ’ s actual well-being , ” which is a scathing review of ideology-based policy . rather than ideology , li believes the economic environment in which policies are made is more important and that policy should not be restricted by the ulterior motives of ideology-based economics . === policy revision === li 's trial and error policy making was made possible by taiwan 's flexible government policy . li says that it made it possible to abandon or modify ineffective programs and easily create and implement new ones in reaction to new situations.li 's policies were often influenced by his experiences as part of the kuomintang in mainland china . hyperinflation was one of the major reasons that chiang kai-shek lost mainland china to the communist party , and thus li abhorred all inflationary finance during his management of taiwan 's economy . his aversion to relying on inflation is apparent in his claim : taiwan ’ s experience shows that fiscal reforms ( tax legislation ) and monetary reforms ( moving toward central bank autonomy ) are major evolu- tionary steps taken by a responsible government . . . what underlies both reforms is a rejection of the insanity of relying on the printing press to create purchasing power for the government to use in an effort to solve socioeconomic problems.li indicates that this was the main difference between taiwan 's policy and those in latin american countries , and that this method of managing the economy led to an overall more responsible government and transparent taxation system . li claims that during the 1950s–70s , the liberalization of taiwan 's economy was an unintended effect of their new policy , and it was n't until <year> that such `` externally-oriented growth '' was seen as beneficial and the merging of international competition in the domestic market was encouraged . furthermore , li says that taiwan 's government was guided at the start with the principle that private property and a market environment which favored private businesses were to be encouraged . li writes : other promotional measures taken by the government included improving the investment climate , simplifying administrative procedures . . . providing necessary financing through banking institutions , and promoting investment and exports through tax relief and other incentives.this was the framework for li 's principle of people 's livelihood where the importance of protecting private property for the improvement of socioeconomic activities and establishing a free economy was only superseded by the need to expand state capital . yu claims that this view falls under what robert wade calls the `` guided market economy . '' li argues that the main problem with other less developed countries ( ldcs ) was that : the alleged failure of the market in some other ldcs may <days> in fact , be due precisely to the opposite reason : the failure of political intervention in the market . although the market structure was far from perfect at the beginning of transition growth in the 1950s , the overall trend has been for a strengthening of the market mechanism—a depoliticizing of the market . taiwan experience shows that reduced intervention can work.li argues that without the same willingness in developing countries to support a free market , taiwan 's economic miracles and history are useless to them . === government 's role === li explains that taiwan 's economic development was initially set back by the `` scarcity of natural resources , shortages of capital and foreign exchange , technological backwardness , and lack of entrepreneurial skills , '' however , through the government 's direct involvement and encouragement , the infrastructure and incentives needed for private enterprises to flourish , including mitigation of risk , was created : among the major initiatives have been : the formulation of investment program and the provision of low-interest loans ; the establishment of industrial zones , export-processing zones , and the science-based industrial park ; ten major development projects , the twelve new development projects and the fourteen key projects in the 1970s and 1980s . the government also adopted various supplementary fiscal , financial , foreign-exchange , and trade-promotion measures to quicken the pace of industrialization.taiwan 's government made certain to not compete with private enterprises unless absolutely necessary , and the most lucrative investment projects were left for private businesses to take . many times the government would first conduct feasibility studies before offering low interest loans to private entrepreneurs . other times the government acted as sole owner of a business before handing it over to private investors.however , li was a strong believer that it was important for the government to step back once the private sector became more established . fiscal policy would then become more of a `` stabilizing and equilibrating mechanism to counterbalance fluctuations in private economic behaviour . the evolution of fiscal policy in taiwan has followed the same progression . . . with government intervention diminishing as the economy moved steadily in the direction of liberalization . `` this leads to li 's argument that there are two main major roles played by the government in economic development : enforcement of competition : to promote competition in small developing countries , it is best to open up the economy and expose domestic enterprises to international competition . li believes anti-trust laws are superfluous in open economies . in new industries , government protection should only be given in the initial period . identify the areas of production characterized by externality ( `` activities where the producers of the goods or services can not easily charge those who benefit '' -- this is somewhat different from the common view of externality ) : goods with external effect are not fixed and will mature with the economy . thus , government operated sectors can become more privatized as the economy matures , although it is reasonably difficult to decide what the government should provide based on external economies , and therefore should remain an ongoing task . === transferability === on the topic of taiwan 's economic success being transferable to other developing countries , li believes that : ... while our policy experiences can not be transferred to ldcs as a whole package , individual measures ( such as epzs and investment incentives ) that i introduced have , from time to time , been adopted successfully by neighbouring countries [ ... ] if an experience can be transferable at all , the key question concerns the circumstances under which the policy is instituted . if the circumstances are too different , it is not likely that the policy will lead to the same result . the question of a policy ’ s result is an economic issue , but the way policy is formulated is a political issue . good economics can be rejected by bad politics . hence , whether or not taiwan ’ s policy experience can be transferred to other developing economies depends very much on whether their cultures can allow pragmatism to overcome ideology as well as on how strongly they are dedicated to political and economic freedom.although taiwan experienced relative economic success over the course of its history along with the other four asian tigers which employed similar economic policies as taiwan , the lack of the same `` miraculous '' development in latin american countries that employed the same principles brings into question whether li 's policies can be fully transferred and result in unequivocal success . li also did not consider external factors that helped taiwan 's initial economic growth , such as the economic and military aid provided by the us government from 1949–1965 , which helped to dampen inflation . === economic achievement === taiwan experienced gdp growth of 10.6 % a year from <year> to <year> with no deterioration in income distribution , an improvement in literacy , a longer life expectancy than almost all other developing countries , increases in manufacturing earnings of <integer> % a year from <year> to <year> , and unemployment at less than <integer> % since <year> . as of <year> , income per person was three to ten times higher than china . in <year> taiwan 's per capita income was below the mediterranean countries , and well below any latin american country and malaysia , whereas by <year> taiwan 's per capita income had reached us $ <year> , much higher than malaysia , brazil , and mexico , and on par with portugal , argentina , and chile.in <year> manufacturing 's share in ndp was <integer> % , high even by standards of industrialized countries . exports consisted of over half of gdp and consist of <integer> % of industrial goods , including textiles , clothes , leather and wood products , radio , television , cassette recorders , electronic calculators , sewing machines , machine tools , semi-conductors , and computers . this was a stark change from <year> 's exports , which were <integer> % agricultural , consisting of mainly sugar and rice.ian little writes , `` government expenditure fell from 19.6 % of gnp in <year> to <integer> % in <year> , whereas [ in <year> ] revenue rose from <integer> % to 22.4 % . '' according to wade however , government expenditure as a share of gnp increased from <integer> % in <year> to <integer> % in <year> and to <integer> % in 1980–81 . however , government revenue increased from 19.3 % in <year> to 25.8 % in <year> . === criticisms === taiwan 's three-year stimulus package in <year> to boost the private sector was nt $ <integer> billion ( us $ 1.5 billion ) and included loans to small and medium-sized business and nt $ <integer> billion for high-tech enterprises . the package also released 30,000 hectares of government owned land to the private sector , offered a five-year tax holiday to high-tech industries , allowed more foreign workers in to supplement the labor shortage in construction and manufacturing , and allowed more semi-finished industrial goods to be imported from mainland china to be processed in taiwan . the goal of the plan was to maintain the expansion of taiwan 's gdp and private investment from falling below their then annual levels of 6–7 % and 10–15 % .critics of the plan included those who worked in manufacturing companies , saying that , `` the government 's plans are so rough that at the industrial level we ca n't work with its programs . '' one such vice-president said that because large private-sector companies planned several years in advance , government policies that are vague and unpredictable can easily go awry . he adds that the amount of funding offered by the government `` ca n't make a dent in what the private sector really needs . `` other critics included businessmen who claimed the plan would only benefit big corporations and not the <integer> % of manufacturing companies that were small and medium-sized . they argued that the cabinet was not counteracting the larger obstacle to private sector growth : the central bank 's anti-inflation policy with high interest rates and tight liquidity . a manager of a computer parts company said , `` it 's easier to raise money in china than here . `` furthermore , there has been considerable criticism on the viability of one `` best practice '' policy to which every developing country should adhere . ha-joon chang argues that many already developed countries did not in fact reach their current development level through using the policies and institutions which they recommend , but in fact actively used `` bad '' trade and industrial policies , such as infant industry protection and export subsidies . chang proposes that many of the institutions which are regarded as necessary for economic development are the effect and not the cause of economic development . chang concludes by suggesting that policies be catered to developing countries depending on their stage of development and needs , rather than by using a blanket set of policies . == legacy == li 's residence in taipei is now a museum . the traditional 1930s style japanese house was li 's home from <year> to <year> . taipei 's former mayor , hau lung-bin , recalls fondly , `` i was so impressed by its furnishings [ ... ] they showed how prudent he was , and he read plenty of books and periodicals .

( `` the rust of greenhouse-grown spearmint and its control '' ) in <year> at cornell university . john 's career focused on potato and potato diseases . he first gained experience with potato while at cornell university , where he worked for the new york state seed certification service during the summer while he was in graduate school . after graduation , he became an extension plant pathologist , replacing mortier barrus , who was the first extension plant pathologist in the united states . in <year> , john was recruited by george harrar , a former student of elvin stakman , to join the rockefeller foundation 's mexican agricultural program . in the 1960s niederhauser worked at map , occupied with the phytophthora infestans situation in central mexico . assuming that the locals had simply never tried breeding for late blight resistance , he was surprised to find that resistant seed he shipped in from new york state fell to the local p. i. races as easily as the local seed stock did . niederhauser then spent the next several years investigating and remedying this problem , by breeding in resistance from wild solanum demissum native to the same area , especially in

his parents were russian jewish immigrants and he and his siblings changed their family name to vernon . he earned a ba cum laude from the college of the city of new york in <year> and a phd in economics from columbia university in <year> ; all three of his siblings also earned doctorates . == career == vernon worked at the securities and exchange commission from <year> to <year> and then at the us department of state , participating in the development and implementation of the marshall plan and also helping facilitate the postwar recovery of japan . he played a role in the development of the international monetary fund and the general agreement on tariffs and trade , including negotiating the inclusion of japan in gatt . in the early 1950s he served as acting director of the office of economic defense and trade policy , overseeing us trade with the soviet bloc and encouraging those countries to trade with non-communist countries.he then worked for two years for mars , heading development of peanut m & m 's ; he was known in the candy industry as `` the man who put the crunch in m & m 's '' .in 1956–59 , he headed the new york metropolitan region study for the harvard graduate school of public administration , forecasting the future development of the conurbation . it was funded by the ford foundation and the rockefeller brothers fund and was a pioneering work of urban studies.from <year> until his retirement , he was a faculty member at harvard , initially at the harvard business school . in <year> , he headed the multinational enterprise project , studying us and foreign multinational companies . from <year> until his retirement , he was at the kennedy school of government , where he was an important member of the center for business and government . he retired as clarence dillon professor of international affairs and held emeritus status.vernon was a pioneer of computerized stock-market analysis . he influenced the harvard business school to study real-world examples of businesses and business situations , which led in particular to harvard researchers studying the world 's largest enterprises . since he had also worked as a political scientist , one focus of his research was the relationship between states and companies : he pointed to the trend for that relationship to become relatively less important and that between companies and customers more so , as business became more international in the post-war world . his work was also a basis for the movement toward privatization in the 1980s . after his death , daniel yergin , a friend and colleague , referred to him as `` the father of globalization '' . === product life-cycle theory === in <year> vernon published an article , `` international investment and international trade in the product cycle '' , which he himself characterized as `` the one which will appear upon my gravestone '' . initially descriptive , showing how foreign direct investment by us firms—the movement to offshore production—followed as a response to consumer demand , or to a lag between product innovation and the ability to manufacture enough to satisfy demand , the theory was taken up by companies and underwent modifications in response . vernon 's analysis nonetheless held true , in particular his identification of three imperatives for success in international business : innovation , responsiveness to varying local markets , and cost . == private life and death == vernon was an excellent rower ;

served as governor of the bank of thailand and rector of thammasat university . he was the author of from womb to tomb : the quality of life of a south-east asian , which to date remains one of the most influential writings about social security in thailand . born to a thai chinese family , puey was a graduate of the first class of thammasat university , teaching as a lecturer of french until winning a scholarship to study economics at the london school of economics in <year> . his studies were interrupted by the second world war , when he joined the free thai resistance movement opposed to the pro-japanese military regime of plaek phibunsongkhram . he was captured as a prisoner of war in <year> after parachuting into chai nat province on a reconnaissance mission . puey completed his studies after the war , receiving a doctorate in <year> . he joined the ministry of finance in <year> , serving in a progression of senior posts before becoming central bank governor in <year> . at <integer> , and serving for over <integer> years , until <year> , puey is to date both the youngest person appointed as , and the longest serving , governor of the bank of thailand . as governor , he played a central role in shaping thailand 's economic development policies during the governments of field marshals sarit dhanarajata and thanom kittikachorn . he also was a proponent of financial co-operation in southeast asia , leading to the establishment of regional financial and institutions such as seacen . he was awarded the magsaysay award in the field of government service in <year> . an active academic , puey was simultaneously dean of the faculty of economics of thammasat university from <year> to <year> . in <year> he was appointed rector of thammasat university , but resigned in protest following the massacre of student protesters on <integer> october <year> . tarred by nationalists as a leftist subversive , he was subsequently forced to flee the country for fear of his is safety , residing in the united kingdom until his death in <year> . == early life and education == puey was born the fourth child of an immigrant chinese fishmonger and a second generation thai chinese mother , with ancestry from raoping . in <year> he was among the first group of students to enrol at the newly opened thammasat university , from which he graduated in <year> . after having briefly worked as a translator , puey earned a government scholarship to study economics at the london school of economics in <year> . === free thai movement === thailand joined the second world war on the side of the axis <days> january <year> , following its invasion by japan the previous month and the subsequent decision of thailand 's military ruler , field marshal plaek phibunsongkhram , to ally with rather than resist the japanese invaders . puey 's studies were as a result interrupted , and he joined the free thai movement resisting the pro-japanese government , helping to organise the movement in the united kingdom . puey was commissioned as a captain into the british army and underwent vigorous training with the special operations executive , <days> november <year> he parachuted into chai nat province in northern thailand as part of operation appreciation , intended to establish contact with the influential and anti-japanese politician pridi banomyong . he was captured almost immediately , and remained technically a prisoner of war until the japanese surrender <days> september <year> , though he in fact made contact with free thai members of the thai police and was able to work with them from his jail cell . after the war , puey was promoted to the rank of major in the british forces and was made a member of the order of the british empire . he resumed his studies , having won a leverhulme trust scholarship , and in <year> received a doctorate in economics from the london school of economics , becoming one of the first thais to do so . his thesis , dated <year> , was titled the economics of tin control . == government service == === ministry of finance === in <year> puey became an economist in the ministry of finance . in <year> he was appointed managing director of the national economic council . === bank of thailand === in <year> , puey was appointed deputy governor of the bank of thailand . upon becoming governor in <year> , puey quickly attracted the attention of international agencies , foreign governments , and the international financial community for the integrity of his financial planning and management . his international stature was recognised ceremoniously in <year> when he became the first thai to receive the magsaysay award for public service . equally important , this international recognition gave him an influence with field marshals sarit thanarat , thanom kittikachorn , and their cohorts which far exceeded his bureaucratic position . they sought his aid and advice as a troubleshooter for thailand 's monetary interests , particularly in matters they had botched or in which they were suspected to have their own private interests , such as remedying sarit 's mishandling of thailand 's participation on an international tin council and preventing a kickback scandal over the foreign printing of thailand 's currency . === other positions === after stepping down as central bank governor , puey was appointed to the un-elected national legislative assembly established under the interim constitution <days> december <year> in the aftermath of thanom 's <year> auto-coup . after thanom 's junta was ousted in a popular uprising in <year> , puey was chosen by caretaker prime minister sanya dharmasakti , who had also served as rector of thammasat university , to chair the government 's economic advisory council . he served in both posts until sanya 's ministry was succeeded by the elected government of seni pramoj following elections in <year> . == academic career == in <year> puey became the dean of the faculty of economics at his alma mater , thammasat university , where his work with the rockefeller foundation and with foreign scholars dramatically upgraded the training of thailand 's future technocrats . he also instituted a long-term research project on raising the productivity and economic level of thai villagers . it was during this period that he was invited to serve as a visiting professor at both cambridge and princeton universities and was appointed to the governing boards of such organisations as the international council for educational development , the east-west center ( ewc ) , the asian institute of management , and the international food policy research institute . puey played an instrumental role in the establishment of the bangkok-based asian institute of technology ( ait ) , previously the graduate school of engineering of the southeast asia treaty organization ( seato ) in <year> . dr puey became the first chairperson of the ait board of trustees from <year> to <year> . after the ousting of thanom 's regime <days> october <year> , puey was catapulted into political prominence and , along with m.r . kukrit pramoj , was broadly promoted as one of the two major candidates for the post of prime minister in the elected government that would follow the palace-picked interim administration of sanya thammasak . however , after a great deal of self-examination , puey disavowed all interest in such a candidacy and returned to thammasat , where he was appointed rector . puey 's explanation was that when he had joined the free thai movement he had taken an oath never to seek or accept political appointment until after reaching the age of retirement . some have argued , however , that puey 's withdrawal was based upon his mature understanding of the nature of society and that he had accurately foreseen that the upcoming democratic period would be inherently unstable , dangerous , and short-lived . == exile == despite his service , honesty and international reputation , puey was branded a communist and `` destroyer of unity '' by the political right of thailand . although he spoke out against the unending student demonstrations of 1975–76 as being both ineffective and self-destructive , and even denied his students any use of the thammasat campus as a base for mounting public demonstrations , he was nevertheless assigned blame for their occurrence . on the evening of the bloody <integer> october <year> massacre , puey resigned from his position as rector of thammasat in protest against the bloodbath that had occurred that day on the university campus . realising he was a marked man , puey went to don mueang airport where he was met by a lynch mob . only with the help of the royal thai air force air police , who had been instructed by king bhumibol 's privy council office to help him leave , did he evade death and get on a plane bound for london.while living abroad , puey met with thais and influential figures in several countries , including those in the united kingdom , the united states , france , germany , sweden , denmark , japan , and australia to speak about the incident and to call for a peaceful transition to democracy in thailand . in <year> , puey gave testimonials before the house committee on foreign affairs investigating human rights in thailand following the incident of <integer> october <year> massacre . <days> september <year> , puey suffered a haemorrhagic stroke and was confined to a hospital for three months . the illness left puey with a speech impediment resulting in mumbling speech . he could walk by himself , but was unable to control his right hand . puey died in london on <integer> july <year> . == legacy == puey 's status as a hero derives from several obvious , but special , features of his career and character . his most significant , if paradoxical , attribute was his willingness to work for the thai bureaucratic establishment and yet maintain his moral independence , intellectual creativity , and sense of social responsibility . his capacity to strike a compromise between what was objectively possible and morally desirable was an extraordinary accomplishment . it had a particular impact on younger people , almost all of whose models have traditionally been either successful rogues who manipulate their social environment for their own advantage or martyrs who succumb to it . even more commendable was his deep sense of incorruptibility . over the years , he held a variety of jobs and served on a number of commissions that , in terms of standard thai corrupt practices , could have made him a very wealthy man . further , puey 's incorruptibility was more than merely passive . as an economist he was keenly aware that official corruption was depriving the thai treasury of inordinately large sums , and in public addresses and statements he would often include selections of thinly veiled , but cutting , poetic attacks against the specific acts of the very highest government officials . puey 's career is also powerful evidence of how education—in contrast to wealth , political power , and connections—could be used to climb the thai status ladder . in <year> he was recognised by unesco for his high ethical standards . == honours == === military rank === major of the british army ===

together they discovered the so-called `` sliding filament theory '' , the underpinning idea on muscle contraction . their publication in the <integer> may <year> issue of nature became a landmark in muscle physiology . they provided the strong evidence for the theory in <year> , in which they showed electron microscopic details of the shortening and elongation of muscle fibres against each other . even then the theory was not easily embraced , even in <year> at a symposium of biomacromolecules held in pittsburgh , pasadena , scientists including the nobel laureate paul flory argued against the sliding process . hanson was remembered reacting , `` i know i can not explain the mechanism yet , but the sliding is a fact . '' after their work in us , hanson and huxley decided to separate their lines of muscle research , and hanson took up those of invertebrate animals . in <year> she became full professor of biology at king 's . in <year> , she succeeded randall as director of the biophysics unit , where she remained until her death in <year> . == honours == jean hanson was elected a fellow of the royal society in <year> . == personal life and death == jean hanson was very unlike the other members of the king 's , who were famous for their antagonism among themselves . she was generous , open-minded , and most of all , eager to help young researchers . she was known as 'jean ' to all .

'' in the same essay , however , kelley went on to state that `` i have no personal doubts that some of the inscriptions which have been reported are genuine celtic ogham . '' kelley concluded : `` despite my occasional harsh criticism of fell 's treatment of individual inscriptions , it should be recognized that without fell 's work there would be no [ north american ] ogham problem to perplex us . we need to ask not only what fell has done wrong in his epigraphy , but also where we have gone wrong as archaeologists in not recognizing such an extensive european presence in the new world .

thomas odum ( september <days> , <year> – september <days> , <year> ) , usually cited as h. t. odum , was an american ecologist . he is known for his pioneering work on ecosystem ecology , and for his provocative proposals for additional laws of thermodynamics , informed by his work on general systems theory . == biography == odum was the third child of howard w. odum , an american sociologist , and his wife , anna louise ( née kranz ) odum ( 1888–1965 ) . he was the younger brother of eugene odum . their father `` encouraged his sons to go into science and to develop new techniques to contribute to social progress '' . howard learned his early scientific lessons about birds from his brother , fish and the philosophy of biology while working after school for marine zoologist robert coker , and electrical circuits from the boy electrician by alfred powell morgan.howard thomas studied biology at the university of north carolina at chapel hill , where he published his first paper while still an undergraduate . his education was interrupted for three years by his world war ii service with the army air force in puerto rico and the panama canal zone , where he worked as a tropical meteorologist . after the war , he returned to the university of north carolina and completed his b.s . in zoology ( phi beta kappa ) in <year> . in <year> , odum married virginia wood , and they later had two children . after wood 's death in <year> , he married elisabeth c. odum ( who had four children from her previous marriage ) in <year> . odum 's advice on how to manage a blended family was to be sure to keep talking ; elisabeth 's was to hold back on discipline and new rules.in <year> , odum earned his ph.d. in zoology at yale university , under the guidance of g. evelyn hutchinson . his dissertation was titled the biogeochemistry of strontium : with discussion on the ecological integration of elements , which brought him into the emerging field of systems ecology . he made a meteorological `` analysis of the global circulation of strontium , [ and ] anticipated in the late 1940s the view of the earth as one great ecosystem '' .while at yale , howard began his lifelong collaborations with his brother eugene . in <year> , they published the first english-language textbook on systems ecology , fundamentals of ecology . howard wrote the chapter on energetics , which introduced his energy circuit language . they continued to collaborate in research as well as writing for the rest of their lives . for howard , his energy systems language ( which he called `` energese '' ) was itself a collaborative tool . from <year> to <year> , odum worked as the director of the marine institute of the university of texas . during this time , he became aware of the interplay of ecological-energetic and economic forces . he taught in the department of zoology at the university of north carolina at chapel hill , and was one of the professors in the new curriculum of marine sciences until <year> . that year he moved to the university of florida , where he taught in the environmental engineering sciences department , founded and directed the center for environmental policy , and founded the university 's center for wetlands in <year> ; it was the first center of its kind in the world that is still in operation today . odum continued this work for <integer> years until his retirement in <year> . in the 1960s and 1970s , odum was also chairman of the international biological program 's tropical biome planning committee . he was supported by large contracts with the united states atomic energy commission , resulting in participation by nearly <integer> scientists , who conducted radiation studies of a tropical rainforest . his featured project at university of florida in the 1970s was on recycling treated sewage into cypress swamps . this was one of the first projects to explore the now widespread approach of using wetlands as water quality improvement ecosystems . this is one of his most important contributions to the beginnings of the field of ecological engineering . in his last years , odum was graduate research professor emeritus and director of the center for environmental policy . he was an avid birdwatcher in both his professional and personal life . the ecological society awarded odum its mercer award to recognize his contributions to the study of the coral reef on eniwetok atoll . odum also received the french prix de vie , and the crafoord prize of the royal swedish academy of science , considered the nobel equivalent for bioscience . charles a. s. hall described odum as one of the most innovative and important thinkers of the time . hall noted that odum , either alone or with his brother eugene , received essentially all international prizes awarded to ecologists . the only higher education institute to award honorary degrees to both odum brothers was ohio state university , which honored howard in <year> and euene in <year> . odum 's contributions to ecosystems ecology have been recognized by the mars society , who named their experimental station the `` h. t. odum greenhouse '' at the suggestion of his former student patrick kangas . kangas and his student , david blersch , made significant contributions to the design of the waste water recycling system on the station . odum 's students have furthered his work at institutions around the world , most notably mark brown at the university of florida , david tilley and patrick kangas at the university of maryland , daniel campbell at the united states environmental protection agency , enrique ortega at the unicamp in brazil , and sergio ulgiati at the university of siena . work done at these institutions continues to evolve and propagate the odum 's concept of emergy . his former students bill mitsch , robert costanza , and karin limburg are some former students who have been recognized internationally for their contributions to ecological engineering , ecological economics , ecosystem science , wetland ecology , estuarine ecology , ecological modeling , and related fields . == work : an overview == odum left a large legacy in many fields associated with ecology , systems , and energetics . he studied ecosystems all over the world , and pioneered the study of several areas , some of which are now distinct fields of research . according to hall ( <year> , p.ix ) , odum published one of the first significant papers in each of the following areas : ecological modeling ( odum 1960a ) ecological engineering ( odum et al . <year> ) ecological economics ( odum <year> ) estuarine ecology ( odum and hoskins <year> ) tropical ecosystems ecology ( odum and pidgeon <year> ) general systems theoryodum 's contributions to these and other areas are summarized below . odum also wrote on radiation ecology , systems ecology , unified science , and the microcosm . he was one of the first to discuss the use of ecosystems for life-support function in space travel . some have suggested that odum was technocratic in orientation , while others believe that he sided with those calling for `` new values '' . == ecological modeling == === a new integrative approach in ecology === in his <year> ph.d. thesis , odum gave a novel definition of ecology as the study of large entities ( ecosystems ) at the `` natural level of integration '' . in the traditional role of an ecologist , one of odum 's doctoral aims was to recognize and classify large cyclic entities ( ecosystems ) . however , another one of his aims was to make predictive generalizations about ecosystems , such as the whole world for example . for odum , as a large entity , the world constituted a revolving cycle with high stability . it was the presence of stability , which odum believed enabled him to talk about the teleology of such systems . while he was writing his thesis , odum felt that the principle of natural selection was more than empirical , because it had a teleological , `` stability over time '' component . as an ecologist interested in the behavior and function of large entities over time , odum sought to give a more general statement of natural selection so that it was equally applicable to large entities as it was to small entities traditionally studied in biology.odum also wanted to extend the scope and generality of natural selection to include large entities such as the world . this extension relied on the definition of an entity as a combination of properties that have some stability with time . odum 's approach was motivated by lotka 's idea 's on the energetics of evolution . === ecosystem simulation === odum used an analog of electrical energy networks to model the energy flow pathways of ecosystems . his analog electrical models had a significant role in the development of his approach to systems and have been recognized as one of the earliest instances of systems ecology.electron flow in the electrical network represented the flow of material ( e.g . carbon ) in the ecosystem , charge in a capacitor was analogous to storage of a material , and the model was scaled to the ecosystem of interest by adjusting the size of electrical component . === ecological analog of ohm 's law === in the 1950s odum introduced his electrical circuit diagrams of ecosystems to the ecological society of america . he claimed that energy was driven through ecological systems by an `` ecoforce '' analogous to the role of voltage in electrical circuits.odum developed an analogue of ohm 's law which aimed to be a representation of energy flows through ecosystems . in terms of steady state thermodynamics , ohm 's law can be considered a special case of a more general flux law , where the flux ( j { \displaystyle j } ) `` is proportional to the driving thermodynamic force ( x { \displaystyle x } ) with conductivity ( c { \displaystyle c } ) '' , or j = c x { \displaystyle j=cx } .kangas states that odum concluded that as thermodynamic systems , ecosystems should also obey the force-flux law , and that ohm 's law and passive electrical analog circuits can be used to simulate ecosystems . in this simulation , odum attempted to derive an ecological analog for electrical voltage . voltage , or driving force , is related to the biomass in pounds per acre . the analogous concept required is the biomass activity , that is , the thermodynamic thrust , which may <days> linear . exactly what this is in nature is still uncertain , as it is a new concept . such a consideration led odum to ask two important methodological questions : what is the electrical significance of a function observed in nature ? given an electrical unit in a circuit , what is it in the ecological system ? for example , what is a diode in nature ? one needs a diode to allow biomass to accumulate after the voltage of the sun has gone down , or else the circuit reverses . higher organisms like fish are diodes . === the silver springs study === silver springs is a common type of spring-fed stream in florida with a constant temperature and chemical composition . the study odum conducted here was the first complete analysis of a natural ecosystem.odum started with an overall model and in his early work used a diagramming methodology very similar to the sankey diagrams used in chemical process engineering.starting from that overall model , odum `` mapped in detail all the flow routes to and from the stream . he measured the energy input of sun and rain , and of all organic matter - even those of the bread the tourists threw to the ducks and fish - and then measured the energy that gradually left the spring . in this way he was able to establish the stream 's energy budget . '' === ecological and biological energetics === around <year> odum directed studies into radioecology , which included the effects of radiation on the tropical rainforest in el verde , puerto rico ( odum and pidgeon ) , and the coral reefs and ocean ecology at eniwetok atoll . the odum brothers were approached by the atomic energy commission to undertake a detailed study of the atoll after nuclear testing ; the atoll was sufficiently radioactive that upon their arrival the odums were able to produce an autoradiographic image of a coral head by placing it on photographic paper . these studies were early applications of energy concepts to ecological systems , and explored the implications of the laws of thermodynamics when used in these new settings.from this view , biogeochemical cycles are driven by radiant energy . odum expressed the balance between energy input and output as the ratio of production ( p ) to respiration ( r ) : p-r . he classified water bodies based on their p-r ratios , which separated autotrophic from heterotrophic ecosystems : `` [ odum 's ] measurements of flowing water metabolism were measurements of whole systems . odum was measuring the community as a system , not adding up the metabolism of the components as lindeman and many others had done '' . this reasoning appears to have followed that of odum 's doctoral supervisor , g. e. hutchinson , who thought that if a community were an organism then it must have a form of metabolism . however , golley notes that odum attempted to go beyond the reporting of mere ratios , a move which resulted in the first serious disagreement in systems energetics . === maximum power theory and the proposal for additional laws of thermodynamics/energetics === in a controversial move , odum and richard pinkerton ( at the time physicist at the university of florida ) were motivated by alfred j. lotka 's articles on the energetics of evolution , and subsequently proposed the theory that natural systems tend to operate at an efficiency that produces the maximum power output , not the maximum efficiency . === energy systems language === by the end of the 1960s , odum 's electronic circuit ecological simulation models were replaced by a more general set of energy symbols . when combined to form systems diagrams , these symbols were considered by odum and others to be the language of the macroscope which could portray generalized patterns of energy flow : `` describing such patterns and reducing ecosystem complexities to flows of energy , odum believed , would permit discovery of general ecosystem principles . '' some have attempted to link it with the universal scientific language projects which have appeared throughout the history of natural philosophy . kitching claimed that the language was a direct result of working with analogue computers , and reflected an electrical engineer 's approach to the problem of system representation : `` because of its electrical analogy , the odum system is relatively easy to turn into mathematical equations ... if one is building a model of energy flow then certainly the odum system should be given serious consideration ... `` === emergy === in the 1990s in the latter part of his career , odum and david m. scienceman developed the idea of emergy as a specific use of the term embodied energy . some consider the concept of `` emergy '' , sometimes briefly defined as `` energy memory '' , as one of odum 's more significant contributions , but the concept is neither free from controversy nor without its critics . odum looked at natural systems as being formed by the use of various forms of energy in the past : `` emergy is a measure of energy used in the past and thus is different from a measure of energy now . the unit of emergy ( past available energy use ) is the emjoule , as distinguished from joules used for available energy remaining now . '' this was conceived as a principle of maximum empower , which might explain the evolution of self-organising open systems . however , the principle has only been demonstrated in a few experiments and is not widely recognized in the scientific community . == ecosystem ecology and systems ecology == for j . b. hagen , the maximum power principle , and the stability principle could be easily translated into the language of homeostasis and cybernetics systems . hagen claims that the feedback loops in ecosystems were , for odum , analogous to the kinds of feedback loops diagrammed in electronic circuits and cybernetic systems . this approach represented the migration of cybernetic ideas into ecology and led to the formulation of systems ecology . in odum 's work these concepts form part of what hagen called an , `` ambitious and idiosyncratic attempt to create a universal science of systems '' . === macroscope === hagen identified the systems , thinking of odum as a form of holistic thinking , who contrasted the holistic thinking of systems science with reductionistic microscopic thinking , and used the term macroscope to refer to the holistic view , which was a kind of `` detail eliminator '' allowing a simple diagram to be created . === microcosms === odum was a pioneer in his use of small closed and open ecosystems in classroom teaching , which were often constructed from fish tanks or bottles and have been called microcosms . hismicrocosm studies influenced the design of biosphere <integer> . == ecological economics == ecological economics is an active field between economics and ecology with annual conferences , international societies , and an international journal . from <year> to <year> , odum worked as director of the marine institute of the university of texas . during this time odum became aware of the interplay of ecological-energetic and economic forces . he therefore funded the research into the use of conventional economic approaches to quantify dollar values of ecological resources for recreational , treatment and other uses . this research calculated the potential value of primary production per bay surface area.for hall the importance of odum 's work came through his integration of systems , ecology , and energy with economics , together with odum 's view that economics can be evaluated on objective terms such as energy rather than on a subjective , willingness to pay basis . == ecological engineering == ecological engineering is an emerging field of study between ecology and engineering concerned with the designing , monitoring and constructing of ecosystems . the term ecological engineering was first coined by odum in <year> , before he worked at the university of florida . ecological engineering , he wrote , is `` those cases where the energy supplied by man is small relative to the natural sources but sufficient to produce large effects in the resulting patterns and processes . '' ecological engineering as a practical field was developed by his former graduate student bill mitsch , who started and continues to edit the standard journal in the field and helped to start both international and u.s. societies devoted to ecological engineering , and has written two textbooks on the subject one of odum 's last papers was his assessment of ecological engineering that was published in the journal ecological engineering in <year> , a year after odum died . == general systems theory == in <year> , odum was elected the 30th president of the international society for the systems sciences , formerly named the international society for general systems research . he presented many papers on the general systems theory at its annual conferences , and edited the last published general systems yearbook . the second , revised edition of his major lifework was retitled ecological and general systems : an introduction to systems ecology ( <year> ) . some of his energy models and simulations contained general systems components . odum has been described as a `` technocratic optimist '' , and his approach was significantly influenced by his father , who was also an advocate of viewing the social world through the various lenses of physical science . within the processes on earth , odum ( <year> ) believed humans play a central role : he said that the `` human is the biosphere 's programmatic and pragmatic information processor for maximum performance '' . == publications == odum wrote around <integer> books and <integer> papers , and a festschrift volume ( maximum power : the ideas and applications of h. t. odum , <year> ) was published in honor of his work.odum was also honored by the journal ecological engineering for his contributions to the field of ecological engineering and general ecology in recognition of his 70th birthday . the publication included over <integer> letters from distinguished scientists from all over the world including mitsch ( lead editorial ) , john allen , robert ulanowitcz , robert beyers , ariel lugo , marth gilliland , sandra brown , ramon margalef , paul risser , eugene odum , kathy ewel , kenneth watt , pat kangas , sven jørgensen , bob knight , rusong wang , john teal , frank golley , annmari and bengt-owe jansson , joan browder , carl folke , richard wiegert , scott nixon , gene turner , john todd , and james zuchetto . === books === <year> , environment , power and society for the twenty-first century : the hierarchy of energy , with mark t. brown , columbia university press . <year> , a prosperous way down : principles and policies , with elisabeth c. odum , university press of colorado . <year> , with e. c. odum , modeling for all scales : an introduction to system simulation , academic press . <year> , heavy metals in the environment : using wetlands for their removal . <year> , biosphere <integer> : research , past and present , with bruno d. v. marino . <year> , environmental accounting : emergy and environmental decision making . <year> , ecological microcosms , with robert j. beyers . <year> , cypress swamps with katherine c. ewel . <year> , systems ecology : an introduction . <year> , energy basis for man and nature , with elisabeth c. odum . <year> , with robert f. pigeon ( eds ) , a tropical rain forest ;

may <days> , <year> – november <days> , <year> ) , was an american zoologist and professor at the university of california , berkeley . he was widely known for portraying prominent historical scientists during some of his lectures ; dressing in costume and speaking in character to entertain and inform his students . a <year> guggenheim fellow , he wrote several books and more than <integer> scientific papers . his research focused on eyes and vision in animals , especially the parietal eye or `` third eye '' of vertebrates , as well as animal embryology . he served as chairman of the uc berkeley department of zoology for over <integer> years , was elected president of the western society of naturalists and american society of zoologists , and was a fellow of the california academy of sciences . eakin was born in florence , colorado , and grew up in tulsa , oklahoma . he initially studied at the university of tulsa , planning a career in the clergy , before switching to zoology , earning a bachelor 's degree and doctorate at uc berkeley . after postdoctoral studies in germany under hans spemann he returned to uc berkeley as a faculty member , where he would teach for over <integer> years , earning awards and recognition for his teaching before retiring with highest faculty honors . == early life and education ( 1910–1936 ) == richard eakin was born on may <days> , <year> , in florence , colorado , to parents marshall and mary elizabeth eakin . he attended high school in tulsa , oklahoma , graduating in <year> . he initially planned to go into the clergy , enrolling in the university of tulsa and studying subjects such as theology and greek for two years , before deciding to pursue zoology.in <year> , eakin moved to berkeley , california to attend uc berkeley . he earned his a.b . in <year> , then enrolled in graduate school under j. franklin daniel , an ichthyologist and embryologist . for his dissertation , eakin studied the development of salamander and frog embryos , earning a phd in zoology in <year> . from <year> to <year> he worked in germany as a postdoctoral scholar in the laboratories of embryologists otto mangold and nobel laureate hans spemann.on august <days> , <year> , eakin married mary mulford , daughter of walter mulford , a berkeley professor of forestry . == career ( 1936–1977 ) == upon his return to uc berkeley in <year> , eakin was appointed instructor of zoology , becoming assistant professor in <year> and full professor in <year> . he was assistant dean of the college of letters and science from <year> to <year> , and chairman of the department of zoology from <year> to <year> , and again from <year> to <year> . as an administrator he helped found the university 's bodega marine laboratory , sagehen creek field station , and cancer research genetics laboratory . in <year> he published a history of zoological research at berkeley spanning the period from the university 's <year> founding through <year> , followed by a <year> companion article covering the intervening <integer> years . === research === eakin was known for his research of animal eyes and photoreceptor cells , especially the parietal eye ( the so-called `` third eye '' ) and associated pineal gland of vertebrates . he was persuaded to study the parietal eyes of reptiles by his colleague robert c. stebbins , and the two published several articles on the parietal eye of western fence lizards . eakin , alone or with colleagues , published many other papers on the anatomy and function of reptilian parietal eyes and similar structures in amphibians . eakin 's <year> monograph , the third eye , was received as comprehensive and detailed enough for biologists , yet in a style approachable to non-scientists or undergraduates . he also studied amphibian development and was recognized as a skilled and early practitioner of electron microscopy . eakin received a guggenheim fellowship in <year> , and the boston museum of science 's walker prize in <year> . he authored or co-authored over <integer> scientific papers , was elected president of the western society of naturalists in <year> and american society of zoologists in <year> , and was a fellow of the california academy of sciences for <integer> years . === `` great scientists speak again '' === in <year> , in order to combat boredom and absenteeism in his introductory zoology course , eakin gave his first lecture in character , appearing unannounced in full costume and makeup as william harvey , the <other> physician who made the first complete descriptions of blood circulation . his portrayals of historic scientists , including charles darwin , louis pasteur , and gregor mendel , often involved elaborate wigs , makeup , costumes , and props , aided by professional makeup artists and drama teachers- his portrayal of darwin required up to three hours of makeup , wig , and beard preparation . his lectures were popular with students from the start and attracted international attention , with profiles in publications such as life , der spiegel , and the international herald tribune . he gave guest lectures at universities nationwide , and in <year> compiled the text of his lectures , along with photographs , diagrams , and stage directions , into a book , great scientists speak again . eakin typically gave six lectures in character during a course , with each `` guest lecturer '' introducing particular concepts . the figures portrayed , in order of appearance during a typical course , were : william harvey ( 1578–1657 ) william beaumont ( 1785–1853 ) hans spemann ( 1869–1941 ) gregor mendel ( 1822–1884 ) louis pasteur ( 1822–1895 ) charles darwin ( 1809–1882 ) eakin considered his impersonation of spemann to be his most authoritative , due to knowing him personally from working in his lab in germany , helping translate a book of his into english , and becoming good friends.eakin was recognized for his teaching long before he first donned a wig : in <year> he was the first recipient of berkeley 's senior citation for distinguished teaching and in <year> received the outstanding teaching award from the associated students of the university of california . == later years ( 1977–1999 ) == eakin retired in <year> and was honored with the berkeley citation , the highest honor given to berkeley faculty . he continued to periodically perform his lectures in character until <year> , and also taught embryology at several historically black colleges and universities in the southern u.s. , including tougaloo college , mississippi ; talladega college and tuskegee university , alabama ; and fisk university in tennessee.eakin was a member of the first congregational church of berkeley for over <integer> years , where his first wife , mary mulford eakin – ordained by the united church of christ – was associate minister . he co-authored a history of the church in <year> . in a <year> interview , eakin stressed that matters of faith and science should be kept separate – as he did in his own life as both a christian and a scientist – and that proponents of teaching creationism alongside evolution in public schools should similarly recognize the differences . `` the great concepts of justice , mercy and love- science can not test them or write a formula '' , he said , `` they are human beliefs and are outside the realm of science . `` his first wife mary , with whom he had three children ( one of whom died prior to <year> ) , died in <year> . he later remarried barbara nichols , a former professor at the university of california , san francisco.eakin died on november <days> , <year> , at his home in danville , california , at the age of <integer> . he was survived by his wife barbara

economist . == biography == karl brunner was born in zurich on <integer> february <year> . he studied economics at the university of zurich and the london school of economics , and earned a doctorate at the university of zurich in <year> . he left switzerland in <year> to take up a position as a visiting fellow at the cowles commission , university of chicago . after a two-year fellowship , brunner moved to los angeles in <year> to begin an academic career at the university of california ( ucla ) , where he worked his way up from assistant professor to associate professor and , from <year> , to full professor . in <year> , he was appointed professor at the ohio state university , before moving to the university of rochester in <year> . in the 1970s , brunner frequently returned to europe after accepting a professorship at the university of konstanz , germany ( 1969–1973 ) and subsequently the university of bern , switzerland ( 1974–1985 ) . in <year> , brunner was named the fred h. gowen professor of economics at the university of rochester , a position he held until his death on <integer> may <year> . over his professional career of <integer> years , karl brunner wrote <integer> journal articles , <integer> books , edited or co-edited <integer> volumes , contributed <integer> articles to books , volumes , conferences and congressional hearings , and left behind <integer> unpublished papers . he founded two leading academic journals , namely the journal of money , credit , and banking ( in <year> ) and the journal of monetary economics ( in <year> ) . he also originated the konstanz , interlaken and carnegie-rochester ( with allan meltzer ) meetings , as well as the shadow open market committee ( in <year> , again with meltzer ) . to commemorate the 100th anniversary of his birthday , the swiss national bank started the karl brunner distinguished lecture series in <year> . the first lecture was given by kenneth rogoff in zurich . == monetarism == karl brunner introduced in <year> the term monetarism into the mainstream vocabulary of economics . fundamentally , brunner conceived monetarism as the application of relative-price theory to the analysis of aggregate phenomena . in his interview with arjo klamer , he notably claimed that : “ the basic tenet of monetarism is the reassertion of the relevance of price theory to understand what happens in aggregate economics . our fundamental point is that price theory is a crucial paradigm – as a matter of fact , the only paradigm – that economists have ” ( klamer <year> , p. <integer> ) . this particular conception of monetarism seems closely related to brunner ’ s experience at ucla : “ most distressing was moreover the encounter with a group of economists systematically applying economic analysis ( i.e . price theory ) to social problems of our world . the resulting confusions yielded a fertile ground for the right environment , and ucla at the beginning of the 1950s was for me the right place . the permanent discussion with a subtle mind ( armen a. alchian ) , the impact of a lucid philosopher of science ( reichenbach ) , and the good fortune of questioning and determined students ( allan h. meltzer , tibor fabian , later on jerry jordan and others ) dispersed the intellectual fogs and gradually structured my thinking about economics and its role in our endeavour to understand the world ” ( brunner <year> , p. <integer> ) . similarly , to the question “ when did you become a monetarist ? ” , brunner answered : “ i find it actually quite interesting in retrospect to retrace the question in my discussions with alchian ” ( klamer <year> , p. <integer> ) . more specifically , brunner considered that “ the major propositions characterizing the monetarist view can be organized into four groups . these groups bear on descriptions of the transmission mechanism , the dynamic properties of the private sector , the dominance and nature of the monetary impulses and the separation of aggregate and allocative forces ” ( brunner <year> , p. <integer> ) . == the transmission of monetary policy == in the above quotation , as well as in other accounts of the main propositions characterizing monetarism , karl brunner systematically mentioned the transmission mechanism of monetary policy first . according to brunner and allan meltzer ( <year> ) , a monetarist transmission mechanism is such that “ changes in money modify relative prices and initiate a process of substitution that spreads to the markets for existing capital securities , loans and current output ” ( p. <integer> ) . the central role played by relative-price movements led brunner to use the terms 'transmission process ' and 'relative-price process ' interchangeably . he actually perceived the transmission mechanism as “ a suitable application of relative price theory ” to explain output and employment fluctuations ( brunner <year> , p. <integer> ) . more precisely , the transmission mechanism of monetary policy considered by brunner and meltzer relies on the relative behavior of two prices . first , the price of existing real assets , denoted by p , which is actually the price of existing real capital . second , the price of output , denoted by p , which is the price of the item used both for building new real capital and for consumption purposes . moreover , brunner and meltzer assumed that the costs of acquiring information are smaller in the assets markets than in the output market . as a result , the speed of adjustment of p in response to shocks is higher than that of p. an increase in the growth rate of money supply thus implies a rise in the ratio of p to p. this means that the price of new capital has fallen relative to the price of existing capital , stimulating private investment ( i.e . the production of new capital ) . furthermore , a rise in the p to p ratio also generates a positive wealth effect and then an increase in private consumption . hence , an expansionary monetary policy raises each component of private aggregate spending through an increase in p/p . it is worth noting that this mechanism is close to the one set out by james tobin ( the so-called tobin ’ s q ) in <year> . == the origin of money == in <year> , karl brunner and allan meltzer delivered an analysis of the origin of money as a medium of exchange . the essentials of the explanation presented there were first set out in a paper published in <year> in the journal of finance ( brunner and meltzer <year> , p. <other> ) . the crucial ingredient is the absence of perfect information about the quality of the goods households seek to purchase . searching for information about the quality of goods involves some costs , whose amount differs substantially across goods . in this context , the goods with comparatively lower information costs for most households will emerge as media of exchange : “ where knowledge of market opportunities and the qualities of goods is neither costless to obtain nor uniformly distributed , the use of money as a medium of exchange reduces the resource cost of exchanging ... for individuals , money is a substitute for investment in information and labor allocated to search . by using money , individuals reduce the amount of information they must acquire , process , and store , and they reduce the number of transactions in which they engage to exchange their initial endowments for optimal baskets of goods ” ( brunner and meltzer <year> , p. <integer> ) . == monetary policy and the defense of money growth rules == in the 1960s , karl brunner ( largely agreeing with milton friedman ) considered that the then-popular literature on optimal policy , in which “ the policy maker is given complete knowledge of the structural relations pertaining to the economy and a set of goal variables that enter the social utility function ” ( brunner and meltzer <year> , p. <integer> ) , missed the essential point of the real-world policy problem . in collaboration with allan meltzer , brunner proposed an analytic framework labelled “ targets and indicators of monetary policy ” , in which monetary policy could usefully be discussed and criticized . in the words of brunner and meltzer ( <year> ) , “ the problem of selecting an indicator of monetary policy is equivalent to the problem of finding a scale that allows us to make reliable statements comparing the thrust of various policy combinations ” ( p. <integer> ) . under conditions of complete knowledge , the indicator problem is totally trivial . in this case , indeed , the thrust of any policy combination on any variable can always be calculated with utter accuracy . under uncertainty , however , things are different . for example , brunner and meltzer showed that , within their framework , the behavior of free reserves ( a widely deployed guide to the stance of monetary policy in the 1960s ) was not monotonically related to the tightness or looseness of policy conceived of in such terms . therefore , to rely upon it was to run the risk of misconstruing policy 's stance , perhaps rendering it pro-cyclical and destabilizing . karl brunner later defended money growth rules of the type proposed by milton friedman . he became convinced that , though discretionary policy did sometimes deliver “ phases of remarkably stability and growth ... such phases depend essentially on transitory political constellations ” ( <year> , p. <integer> ) . thus “ the nature of the monetary order and not the specific actions within a discretionary regime emerged in recent years as the central issue of a more fundamental policy problem ” ( p. <integer> ) . as a result , there is a clear “ advantage of a monetary order based on a constant monetary growth ” ( p. <integer> ) . == the criticism of walrasian economics == a short time before passing away , karl brunner defined monetarism as a “ 'classical ' programme of a non-walrasian tradition ” ( brunner <year> , p. <integer> ) . walrasian economics would notably be unable to account for the emergence of many institutions , and especially money : “ the walrasian paradigm , based on the absence of information and transaction costs , necessarily omits all social phenomena conditioned by the operation of such costs . with full information and in the absence of any transaction costs there is no reason for the occurrence of money , on financial intermediaries and no rationale for many other social institutions ... important problems of our monetary and financial reality remain inaccessible to such a walrasian tradition ” ( p. <integer> ) . among neo-walrasian economists , karl brunner focused attention on the authors of new classical macroeconomics ( nmc ) . a first criticism directed towards ncm relates to the rational expectations hypothesis . under this hypothesis , “ people are assumed to know the policy rule used by the monetary ( and fiscal ) authorities and to have detailed knowledge about the structure of the economy including the size and timing of responses to shocks of various kinds . these assumptions make the models analytically tractable but , taken literally ( as they often are ) , they distort the economist 's view of the policy problem by ignoring uncertainty , incomplete knowledge about the structure of the economy and the costs of acquiring information and reducing uncertainty ” ( brunner and meltzer <year> , p. <integer> ) . a second criticism addressed by brunner to ncm concerns the intertemporal concept of equilibrium : “ i also have strong reservations about crucial aspects of their 'equilibrium approach ' ” ( klamer <year> , p. <integer> ) . to the question “ so what is wrong with new classical economics ? ” , brunner answered : “ their interpretation of equilibrium analysis seems dubious to me . this specific kind of equilibrium analysis implies that all prices are market-clearing relative to all shock-realizations ” ( p. <integer> ) . as a result , ncm can not explain “ the lamented unresponsiveness of prices to current conditions ” ( brunner <year> , p. <integer> ) , i.e . price stickiness . == philosophy of science and evolutionary perspective == looking back on his career , karl brunner considered that he had paid attention to “ three distinct major groups of problems . one covers the range of monetary analysis and policy and a second involves the nature of our cognitive endeavors expressed by our pursuits . the last strand of my persistent interests developed over time from my occupation with the previous two problems . there evolved a gradual understanding that economic analysis offers a systematic approach to the whole range of sociopolitical reality ” ( brunner <year> , p. <integer> ) . this section deals with the second and third groups . in a paper entitled “ assumptions and the cognitive quality of theorie ” , karl brunner argued that milton friedman ( in his famous “ methodology of positive economics ” ) had been right that “ the cognitive quality of a theory can not be judged by the realism of 'assumptions ' but must be judged by the confrontation of its implications with suitable observations ” ( brunner <year> , p. <integer> ) . brunner further stressed the impossibility of ever obtaining definitive confirmation of any general theory from a finite array of empirical evidence . rather , and like karl popper ( <year> ) , he pointed out the capacity of such evidence to falsify theories . at the same time , “ it is , however , important to emphasise that actual refutation by a falsifying test statement is a necessary but far from sufficient reason to reject a theory . our choice is frequently between quite imperfect theories , i.e. , theories which had ( sic ) been ex posed to some falsifying test-statements . the comparative extent of falsification shapes the decision and not falsification as such ” ( p. <integer> ) . karl brunner also developed an evolutionary approach of the economic agent ( notably inspired by the seminal paper of armen alchian ( <year> ) ) . in association with william meckling , brunner introduced the acronym remm , for 'resourceful , evaluating , maximizing man ' . according to brunner ( <year> ) , “ resourcefulness , evaluating and maximizing behavior possess a common basis ... ( for which ) the individual is born with a biological and genetic heritage ” ( p. <integer> ) . however , the term 'maximizing ' should not be understood in the usual sense of the neoclassical theory . indeed , “ rationality is perhaps a more basic component of the hypothesis than maximizing behavior . limited computational facilities of computers and human minds , the cost of gathering and interpreting information , and often a diffuse uncertainty prevent the expression of rational behavior in terms of straightforward maximization . rational behavior produces instead a set of more or less conscious rules of procedure ” ( p. <integer> ) . this remm can be contrasted with alternative “ conceptions of man ” , namely the “ political ” , “ sociological ” , and “ psychological ” ones . brunner and meckling ( <year> ) notably applied this approach to the analysis of the government : “ much of the conflict about government can ... be reduced to the conflict between alternative models of man ” ( p. <integer> ) . == bibliography == brunner , karl , <year> . `` monetary management , domestic inflation , and imported inflation .

<year> – <integer> may <year> ) was a brazilian theatre practitioner , drama theorist , and political activist . he was the founder of theatre of the oppressed , a theatrical form originally used in radical left popular education movements . boal served one term as a vereador ( the brazilian equivalent of a city councillor ) in rio de janeiro from <year> to <year> , where he developed legislative theatre . == biography == === early life === augusto boal studied at columbia university in new york with the critic john gassner . gassner introduced boal to the techniques of both bertolt brecht and konstantin stanislavski , and encouraged boal to form links with theatre groups like the black experimental theatre . in <year> boal staged productions of two of his own plays , the horse and the saint and the house across the street . in <year> , shortly after graduating , boal was asked to work with the arena theatre in são paulo , southeast brazil . boal was in charge of directing plays along with other dramaturgs such as josé renato , who was also the founder of the arena theatre . it was here that he began to experiment with new forms of theatre never before seen in brazil , such as stanislavski 's 'system ' for actors , with which he became familiar during his time at columbia and when involved with the actors studio in new york . boal adapted these methods to social conditions in brazil , taking a leftist approach on issues concerning nationalism , which were very much in vogue at that time period since the country had just undergone a long period of military dictatorship . === work at the arena theatre of são paulo === while working at the arena theatre in são paulo , boal directed a number of classical dramas , which he transformed to make them more pertinent to brazilian society and its economy . among these plays was john steinbeck 's of mice and men , known in brazil as ratos e homens . this was boal 's first performance as a director at the arena theatre of são paulo . critics acclaimed this piece and boal won the prêmio de revelação de direção ( direction revelation award ) from the association of art critics of são paulo , in <year> . in the early sixties , the ratings at the arena theatre of são paulo started to drop , almost causing the theatre to go bankrupt . consequently , the company decided to start investing in national theatre ( pieces written by brazilian dramaturgs ) as a move that could possibly save it from bankruptcy . the new investment proved to be a success , opening up the path for a national theatre scene . boal then suggested the creation of a seminar in dramaturgy at the arena theatre , which was quickly implemented and soon became a national platform for many young playwrights . many successful productions were born from this seminar and now form part of the arena theatre of são paulo 's nationalist phase repertoire . one of these productions was chapetuba futebol clube , written by oduvaldo vianna filho in <year> and directed by augusto boal . === exile === a new military regime started in brazil in <year> with a coup d'état supported by the brazilian elite , the industrialists , the military , as well as by the united states , boal 's teachings were controversial , and as a cultural activist he was seen as a threat by the brazilian military regime . in <year> , boal was kidnapped off the street , arrested , tortured , and eventually exiled to argentina , where he stayed for five years . during those five years , boal published two books : torquemada ( <year> ) and his much acclaimed theatre of the oppressed ( <year> ) . torquemada is about the brazilian military regime 's systematic use of torture in prison . boal takes the name of the leading figure of the spanish inquisition , tomas de torquemada , as an example of historical forms of systematic torture . in theatre of the oppressed boal develops a theatrical method based on pedagogy of the oppressed , a book by the brazilian educator and writer paulo freire ( who was also a good friend of boal ) .boal 's method ( which has been implemented in various communities around the world ) seeks to transform audiences into active participants in the theatrical experience . boal argues that traditional theatre is oppressive since spectators usually do not get a chance to express themselves and that a collaboration between both parties , in contrast , allows spectators to perform actions that are socially liberating . the method , as boal liked to explain , seeks to transform spectators into `` spect-actors . '' when the political climate in brazil forced boal into exile in <year> , he initially went to peru and then argentina , where he completed and published his seminal theoretical work the theatre of the oppressed and consolidated his conscientização ( consciousness-raising ) theatre work based on the idea of brazilian educationalist paulo freire . freire 's methods were a revolt against the elitist `` top-down '' approach to education and he advocated critical-awareness-based education models . boal 's work in peru with the alfin project , a movement which sought to use a range of languages including `` artistic languages '' to eradicate illiteracy , developed his ideas and methodology away from the agit-prop of his brazilian arena theatre days and sought to engage theatre as a pedagogical tool . crucial to this time was boal 's attempts to break down the divisions between spectator and actor . it is around this time that invented the term `` spect-actor '' , a term that he saw as establishing the frameworks within which he wished to work . he saw that the passivity of the spectator could be broken down by the following steps by which the spectator becomes the spect-actor : knowing the body ( by body he means both the individual `` body '' and the collective `` body '' in a marxist sense ) making the body expressive using theatre as a language using theatre as discourseafter living in argentina , boal travelled to other countries in south america such as peru and ecuador , where he worked with people in small and usually poor communities that dealt with conflicts such as civil wars and lack of government attention . boal was of the opinion that only the oppressed are able to free the oppressed . in peru , boal practiced his forum theatre method , in which spectator replaces actor to determine the solution to a given problem presented by the actor , which can also be a real problem someone in the community is facing . boal also lived in paris , france , for a number of years , where he created several centers for the theatre of the oppressed , directed plays , and also taught classes at the sorbonne university . boal created the first international festival for the theatre of the oppressed in 1981.while boal was in exile , his very close friend and brazilian musician chico buarque wrote him a letter that would later result in the chorinho hit called `` meu caro amigo '' or `` my dear friend '' ( <year> ) . in this song , buarque tells his friend about the situation in brazil at the time , addressing the military dictatorship in a very subtle but clever way ( due to censorship issues , many artists could not express themselves freely ) . the melody of the song is very happy and upbeat while the lyrics explain : my dear friend , please forgive me , if i can ’ t pay you a visit , but since i found someone to carry a message , i ’ m sending you news on this tape . here we play football , there ’ s lots of samba , lots of choro and rock ’ n'roll . some days it rains , some days it ’ s sunny but i want to tell you that things here are pretty dark . here , we ’ re wheeling and dealing for survival , and we ’ re only surviving because we ’ re stubborn . and everyone ’ s drinking because without cachaça , nobody survives this squeeze . === center for the theatre of the oppressed-cto-brazil === after the fall of the military dictatorship , boal returned to brazil after <integer> years of exile in <year> . he established a major center for the theatre of the oppressed in rio de janeiro ( cto ) , whose objective was to study , discuss and express issues concerning citizenship , culture and various forms of oppression using theatrical language . boal 's work in the cto made way for the approval of a new law that protects crime victims and witnesses in brazil . boal 's group has worked next to numerous organizations that fight for human rights . in <year> , boal ran for city councillor in rio de janeiro as a theatrical act , and he was elected . boal 's support staff was his theatre group , with whom he quickly developed various legislative proposals . his objective was to work out issues citizens might be facing in their communities through theatre and also to discuss the laws of the city of rio with people on the streets . after having worked to transform spectator into author in theatre of the oppressed , boal initiates the legislative theatre movement process , in which voter becomes legislator . boal is known to say that he did not create laws arbitrarily while he was city councillor . instead , he asked people what they wanted . other politicians were not very fond of this . out of <integer> of boal 's proposed laws , only <integer> got approved during his term as councillor of rio de janeiro . his term ended in <year> , but he continued performing legislative theatre acts with different groups in brasília , where four more laws got approved even after boal had left . boal also worked with prisoners in rio and são paulo . boal argued that people in prison are not free in space , but that they are in time , and that the theatre of the oppressed strives to create different types of freedom so that people are able to imagine and think about the past , the present , and invent the future instead of having to wait for it . all this was in order for prisoners to have `` a healthier and more creative lifestyle . '' people in the movimento sem terra or landless workers movement of brazil also experienced working with boal 's theatre methods . boal 's son julián worked along with his father and now continues to take the theatre of the oppressed to various communities in brazil and around the world . <days> march <year> , he received the title of `` world theatre ambassador '' from unesco . === death === augusto boal died on <integer> may <year> at the age of <integer> in rio de janeiro . critic yan michalski argues that augusto boal is the best-known and most respected brazilian theatre practitioner abroad . == influences == most of augusto boal 's techniques were created after he realized the limitations of didactic , politically motivated theatre in the poor areas where he worked . he found that his attempts to inspire the people living in poor or `` slum '' areas to rise up against racial and class inequality were inhibited by his own racial and class background , since he was white and comparatively financially comfortable , as well as his and his colleagues ' inhibitions to perform violence themselves . his new techniques allowed the idea of rebellion and the impetus for change to come from within the target group . much of his early work and teaching was inspired by marxist philosophy , although much of his work now falls within the boundaries of a center-left ideology . paulo freire was a major influence on boal 's teachings . he and freire became close in later years . when freire died , boal said : `` i am very sad . i have lost my last father . now all i have are brothers and sisters '' .boal was also known to quote william shakespeare 's hamlet , in which hamlet argues that theatre is like a mirror that reflects our virtues and defects equally . although boal found this quote beautiful , he liked to think of theatre as a mirror in which one can reach in to change reality and to transform it . == published works == === theatre of the oppressed ( london : pluto press , <year> ) === arguably augusto boal 's most academically influential work is the theatre of the oppressed , in which the reader follows boal 's detailed analysis of the poetics of aristotle and the early history of western theatre . boal contends that the aristotelian ethic means oppressing the masses , the people , the workers and the spectators in favour of stability and the continued dominance of a privileged few . he argues that the tragi-drama , a formulaic drama style that today could be considered similar to that of soap operas , helps the state promote its continued existence . he sees the brazilian government as an example of an oppressive state using theatre to propagate its oppressive system . he then outlines his early theories and practices for attempting to reverse the paradigm . it also talks about newspaper theatre , attempting to talk about local problems and present it to the audiences , forum theatre , currently used in over <integer> countries , invisible theatre , used to discuss political activity and image theatre . theatre of the oppressed has been translated to more than <integer> languages over the years . boal also talks about invisible theatre in which an event is planned and scripted but does not allow the spectators to know that the event is happening . actors perform out of the ordinary roles which invite spectators to join in or sit back and watch . one example was in a restaurant at the chiclayo hotel , actors sat at separate tables and informed the waiters in loud voices that they could not eat the food . the actor stated that the food was not good . the waiter says the diner could pick something else to eat . so the actor chose a rather expensive item off the menu and says he will be able to pay for it . the actor mentions he has no money and he would be willing to work for it . this display made other diners start discussing the price and treatment of workers at this hotel . this act allowed spectators to think about issues that were going on but was brushed over because the issue did not directly involve them . analytical theatre is when a participant tells a story and the actors improvise it . each character is broken down into all the social roles they could follow and the participants choose an object to symbolize the role . this aspect of theatre allows the participants to see how there are multiple roles a person could follow . === games for actors and non-actors ( london : routledge , <year> ; second edition <year> ) === this is probably augusto boal 's most practically influential book , in which he sets down a brief explanation of his theories , mostly through stories and examples of his work in europe , and then explains every drama exercise that he has found useful in his practice . in contrast to theatre of the oppressed , it contains little academic theory and many practical examples for drama practitioners to use even if not practising theatre that is related to boal 's academic or political ideas . boal refers to many of these as `` gamesercises '' , as they combine the training and `` introversion '' of exercises with the fun and `` extroversion '' of games . it has been influential in the development of community theatre and theatre in education ( t.i.e . ) practices worldwide , especially in europe and south america . these games include carnival in rio and your friend is dead . === the rainbow of desire : the boal method of theatre and therapy . ( london : routledge , <year> ) === this book re-evaluates the practices commonly associated with the theatre of the oppressed for a new purpose . it has been argued that boal contradicts himself with this take on his work , as it mostly concerns itself with creating harmony within society , whereas his early work was concerned with rebellion and upheaval . boal states that , `` theatre is the passionate combat of two human beings on a platform . '' however , boal 's works can be seen as a progression and exploration of a left wing world view rather than a unified theory . in the context of those under-represented in a society , his methodology can be used as a weapon against oppressors . in the context of those in a society who are in need of catharsis for the sake of their own integration into it , it can be switched round to empower that individual to break down internal oppressions that separate that individual from society . through his work at french institutions for the mentally ill and elsewhere in europe , where he discovered concepts such as the `` cop in the head '' , the theories presented in this book have been useful in the pioneering field of drama therapy and have been applied by drama practitioners . boal states in his work that there are three properties of the aesthetic space . first , is plasticity . he says that one can be without being . objects can acquire different meaning such as an old chair representing a king 's throne . he states that only duration counts and location can be changed . second , is that the aesthetic space is dichotomic and it creates dichotomy . this idea suggests that there is a space within a space . the stage is in front of the audience and the actor is creating his own space . third , is telemicroscopic . this idea creates the idea that it is impossible to hide on stage . every aspect of the space is seen and it makes the far away close-up . === other books === legislative theatre : using performance to make politics . london : routledge , <year> .

the unesco pablo picasso medal , and <days> august <year> , he was awarded the `` career achievement award '' by the association of theatre in higher education at their national conference in chicago , illinois . boal is also seen as the inspiration behind <other> forms of performance-activism , such as the `` optative theatrical laboratories '' . boal received the cross border award for peace and democracy by dundalk institute of technology in <year> . boal has in many ways influenced many artists in new media with his participatory modes of expression , especially as the world wide web has become such a powerful tool for participation and communication . notable examples include learning to love you more , happenings , and steve lambert 's why they hate us . == see also == applied drama

december <days> , <year> ) was an american pioneer of radio astronomy , which combined his interests in amateur radio and amateur astronomy . he was instrumental in investigating and extending karl jansky 's pioneering work , and conducted the first sky survey in the radio frequencies.his <year> radio antenna was the second ever to be used for astronomical purposes and the first parabolic reflecting antenna to be used as a radio telescope . for nearly a decade he was the world 's only radio astronomer . == life == reber was born and raised in wheaton , illinois , a suburb of chicago , and graduated from armour institute of technology ( now illinois institute of technology ) in <year> with a degree in electrical engineering . he was an amateur radio operator , and worked for various radio manufacturers in chicago from <year> to <year> . when he learned of karl jansky 's work in <year> , he decided this was the field he wanted to work in , and applied to bell labs , where jansky was working . however , this was during the height of the great depression and there were no jobs available . === early experimentation === in the summer of <year> , reber decided to build his own radio telescope in his back yard in wheaton , il . reber 's radio telescope was considerably more advanced than jansky 's , and consisted of a parabolic sheet metal dish <integer> meters in diameter , focusing to a radio receiver <integer> meters above the dish . the entire assembly was mounted on a tilting stand , allowing it to be pointed in various directions , though not turned . the telescope was completed <days> september 1937.reber 's first receiver operated at <year> mhz and failed to detect signals from outer space , as did his second , operating at <integer> mhz . finally , his third attempt , at <integer> mhz , was successful in <year> , confirming jansky 's discovery . in <year> , he achieved his first professional publication , in the astrophysical journal , but reber refused a research appointment with yerkes observatory . he turned his attention to making a radiofrequency sky map , which he completed in <year> and extended in <year> . he published a considerable body of work during this era , and was the initiator of the `` explosion '' of radio astronomy in the immediate post-second world war era . his data , published as contour maps showing the brightness of the sky in radio wavelengths , revealed the existence of radio sources such as cygnus a and cassiopeia a for the first time . for nearly a decade from <year> on he was the world 's only radio astronomer , a field that only expanded after world war two when scientists , who had gained a great deal of knowledge during the wartime expansion of radar , entered the field , starting with project diana . during this time he uncovered a mystery that was not explained until the 1950s . the standard theory of radio emissions from space was that they were due to black-body radiation , light ( of which radio is a non-visible form ) that is given off by all hot bodies . using this theory one would expect that there would be considerably more high-energy light than low-energy , due to the presence of stars and other hot bodies . however reber demonstrated that the reverse was true , and that there was a considerable amount of low-energy radio signal . it was not until the 1950s that synchrotron radiation was offered as an explanation for these measurements . reber sold his telescope to the national bureau of standards , and it was erected on a turntable at their field station in sterling , virginia . eventually the telescope made its way to the national radio astronomy observatory in green bank , west virginia , and reber supervised its reconstruction at that site . reber also helped with a reconstruction of jansky 's original telescope . === medium frequency research === starting in <year> , he received generous support from the research corporation in new york , and moved to hawaii . in the 1950s , he wanted to return to active studies but much of the field was already filled with very large and expensive instruments . instead he turned to a field that was being largely ignored , that of medium frequency ( hectometre ) radio signals in the 0.5–3 mhz range , around the am broadcast bands . however , signals with frequencies below <integer> mhz are reflected by an ionized layer in the earth 's atmosphere called the ionosphere . in <year> , reber moved to tasmania , the southernmost state of australia , where he worked with bill ellis at the university of tasmania . there , on very cold , long , winter nights the ionosphere would , after many hours shielded from the sun 's radiation by the bulk of the earth , 'quieten ' and de-ionize , allowing the longer radio waves into his antenna array . reber described this as being a `` fortuitous situation '' . tasmania also offered low levels of man-made radio noise , which permitted reception of the faint signals from outer space . in the 1960s , he had an array of dipoles set up on the sheep grazing property of dennistoun , about 7.5 km northeast of the town of bothwell , tasmania , where he lived in a house of his own design and construction he decided to build after he purchased a job lot of coach bolts at a local auction . he imported 4x8 douglas fir beams directly from a sawmill in oregon , and then high technology double glazed window panes , also from the us . the bolts held the house together . the window panes formed a north facing passive solar wall , heating mat black painted , dimpled copper sheets , from which the warmed air rose by convection . the interior walls were lined with reflective rippled aluminium foil . the house was so well thermally insulated that the oven in the kitchen was nearly unusable because the heat from it , unable to escape , would raise the temperature of the room to over <integer> °c ( <integer> °f ) . === final years === his house was never completely finished . it was meant to have a passive heat storage device , in the form of a thermally insulated pit full of dolerite rocks , underneath , but although his mind was sharp , his body started to fail him in his later years , and he was never able to move the rocks . he was fascinated by mirrors and had at least one in every room . he had one of the amplifiers from the prime focus of his first telescope , probably the one used at <integer> mhz . it was of compact point-to-point construction and used two r.c.a . type <integer> `` acorn '' thermionic valves . all the rubber-insulated wires in it had perished and the rubber was hard and crumbly . he powered this amplifier , and all his later receivers at dennistoun , from batteries , to avoid interference entering the equipment along power cables . reber was not a believer of the big bang theory ; he believed that red shift was due to repeated absorption and re-emission or interaction of light and other electromagnetic radiations by low density dark matter , over intergalactic distances , and he published an article called `` endless , boundless , stable universe '' , which outlined his theory . reber was supportive of the tired light explanation for the redshift-distance relationship.he was looked after in his final days at the ouse district hospital , about <integer> km northwest of hobart , tasmania , where he died in <year> , two days before his 91st birthday . his ashes are located at bothwell cemetery , just past new norfolk in tasmania and at many major radio observatories around

pontifical academy of social sciences . rémond is the originator of the famous division of french right-wing parties and movement into three different currents , each one of which appeared during a specific phase of french history : legitimism ( counter-revolutionaries ) , orléanism , and bonapartism . boulangisme , for example , was according to him a type of bonapartism , as was gaullism . these he considers as being authoritarian , needing a leader with charisma , and presenting their movements as more `` populist '' than the others . legitimism refers to the royalists who refused to accept the french republic during the 19th century .

the golden pheasant and the lady amherst 's pheasant . he wrote numerous letters and articles on the subject of these two birds . he even resigned from the royal society for the protection of birds to protest its perceived lack of support for saving these pheasants , which had been introduced to parts of rural england . unlike most ornithologists and bird watchers , goodwin supported the plight of introduced bird species in britain and elsewhere . however , he did not support the reintroduction of raptor species , even regarding the white-tailed eagle as a potential danger to other species.derek goodwin died on <integer> may <year> , at the age of <integer> . == selected works == crows of the world ( <year> ) pigeons and doves of the world ( <year> ) estrildid finches of the world ( <year> ) birds in man ’ s world == references == vladimir sokolov ( february <days> , <year> – april <days> , <year> ) was a russian scientist in the field of zoology and ecology . he was a member of the ussr academy of sciences , russian academy of science and the brundtland commission . he was one of the pioneers of the russian environmentalism movement and one of the early global sustainability advocates.sokolov was professor and head of the department of vertebrate zoology at the faculty of biology at moscow state university ;

'' after his return to england in early august <year> , his mother mary was remarried to lionel smith ( 1880–1972 ) , the eldest son of a. l. smith , whose daughter dorothy was also married to alan 's uncle robert howard hodgkin.in autumn of <year> hodgkin started as a freshman scholar at trinity college , cambridge where his friends included classicists john raven and michael grant , fellow-scientists richard synge and john h. humphrey , as well as polly and david hill , the children of nobel laureate archibald hill . he took physiology with chemistry and zoology for the first two years , including lectures by nobel laureate e.d . adrian . for part ii of the tripos he decided to focus on physiology instead of zoology . nevertheless , he participated in a zoological expedition to the atlas mountains in morocco led by john pringle in <year> . he finished part ii of the tripos <days> july <year> and stayed at trinity as a research fellow.during his studies , hodgkin , who described himself as `` having been brought up as a supporter of the british labour party '' was friends with communists and actively participated in distribution of anti-war pamphlets . at cambridge , he knew james klugmann and john cornford , but he emphasised in his autobiography that none of his friends `` made any serious effort to convert me [ to communism ] , either then or later . '' from <year> to <year> , hodgkin was a member of the cambridge apostles . == pre-war research == hodgkin started conducting experiments on how electrical activity is transmitted in the sciatic nerve of frogs <days> july <year> . he found that a nerve impulse arriving at a cold or compression block , can decrease the electrical threshold beyond the block , suggesting that the impulse produces a spread of an electrotonic potential in the nerve beyond the block . in <year> , hodgkin was invited by herbert gasser , then director of the rockefeller institute in new york city , to work in his laboratory during 1937–38 . there he met rafael lorente de nó and kenneth stewart cole with whom he ended up publishing a paper . during that year he also spent time at the woods hole marine biological laboratory where he was introduced to the squid giant axon , which ended up being the model system with which he conducted most of the research that eventually led to his nobel prize . in spring <year> he visited joseph erlanger at washington university in st. louis who told him he would take hodgkin 's local circuit theory of nerve impulse propagation seriously if he could show that altering the resistance of the fluid outside a nerve fibre made a difference to the velocity of nerve impulse conduction . working with single nerve fibres from shore crabs and squids , he showed that the conduction rate was much faster in sea water than in oil , providing strong evidence for the local circuit theory.after his return to cambridge he started collaborating with andrew huxley who had entered trinity as a freshman in <year> , three years after hodgkin . with a £300 equipment grant from the rockefeller foundation , hodgkin managed to set up a similar physiology setup to the one he had worked with at the rockefeller institute . he moved all his equipment to the plymouth marine laboratory <days> july <year> . there , he and huxley managed to insert a fine cannula into the giant axon of squids and record action potentials from inside the nerve fibre . they sent a short note of their success to nature just before the outbreak of world war ii . == wartime activities == despite his quaker upbringing , hodgkin was eager to join the war effort as contact with the nazis during his stay in germany in <year> had removed all his pacifist beliefs . his first post was at the royal aircraft establishment where he worked on issues in aviation medicine , such as oxygen supply for pilots at high altitude and the decompression sickness caused by nitrogen bubbles coming out of the blood . <days> february <year> he transferred to the telecommunications research establishment ( tre ) where he worked on the development of centimetric radar , including the design of the village inn aglt airborne gun-laying system . he was a member of e.g . bowen 's group in st athan in south wales and lived in a local guest house together with john pringle and robert hanbury brown . the group moved to swanage <days> may <year> where pringle replaced bowen as leader of the group . <days> march <year> , hodgkin flew on the test flight of a bristol blenheim fitted with the first airborne centimetric radar system . <days> february and march <year> , hodgkin visited the mit radiation laboratory to help foster the interchange of information on developments in radar between britain and america.providing a readable account of the little-known piece of military history that he was a part of during world war ii was a main motivation for hodgkin to write his autobiography chance and design : reminiscences of science in peace and war . == 1945–1963 : action potential theory and nobel prize == as the allied forces ' invasion of france and their continued advance towards germany in autumn <year> suggested an end of the war in the foreseeable future , hodgkin started to plan his return to a career in research at cambridge . he renewed his collaboration with w. a. h. rushton and they published an article on how to calculate a nerve fibre 's membrane resistance , membrane capacity , its axoplasm 's resistance , and the resistance of the external fluid in which the fibre is placed , from experimental observations.after being released from military service <days> august <year> upon adrian 's request , hodgkin was able to restart his experiments in collaboration with bernard katz and his pre-war collaborator andrew huxley . they spent the summers of <year> , <year> , and <year> at the plymouth marine laboratory where they continued to measure resting and action potentials from inside the giant axon of the squid . together with katz , he provided evidence that the permeability of the neuronal cell membrane for sodium increased during an action potential , thus allowing sodium ions to diffuse inward . the data they had obtained in <year> resulted in a series of five papers published in the journal of physiology that described what became later known as the hodgkin–huxley model of the action potential and eventually earned hodgkin and huxley the nobel prize in physiology or medicine . building on work by kenneth s. cole they used a technique of electrophysiology , known as the voltage clamp to measure ionic currents through the membranes of squid axons , while holding the membrane voltage at a set level . they proposed that the characteristic shape of the action potential is caused by changes in the selective permeability of the membrane for different ions , specifically sodium , potassium , and chloride . a model that relies on a set of differential equations and describes each component of an excitable cell as an electrical element was in good agreement with their empirical measurements . the cell membrane depolarisation sequence where a small depolarization leads to an increase in sodium permeability , which leads to influx of sodium ions , which in turn depolarizes the membrane even more is now known as the hodgkin cycle.in addition , hodgkin and huxley 's findings led them to hypothesize the existence of ion channels on cell membranes , which were confirmed only decades later . confirmation of ion channels came with the development of the patch clamp leading to a nobel prize in <year> for erwin neher and bert sakmann , and in <year> for roderick mackinnon.after establishing ion movements across a selectively permeable cell membrane as the mechanism of the action potential , hodgkin turned his attention to how the ionic interchange that occurs during the action potential could be reversed afterwards . together with richard keynes he demonstrated that in addition to the changes in permeability that lead to an action potential there is a secretory mechanism that ejects sodium and absorbs potassium against the electrochemical gradients . a few year later , the danish scientist jens christian skou discovered the enzyme na+/k+-atpase that uses atp to export three sodium ions in exchange for two potassium ions that are imported , for which he received the nobel prize in chemistry in <year> . hodgkin was nominated for the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in <year> by lord adrian . <days> october <year> , he was told by swedish journalists that he , huxley , and eccles had been awarded the nobel prize . this turned out to be a false alarm , however , when shortly thereafter it was announced that the <year> prize was awarded to georg von békésy . it was only two years later that hodgkin , huxley , and eccles were finally awarded the prize `` for their discoveries concerning the ionic mechanisms involved in excitation and inhibition in the peripheral and central portions of the nerve cell membrane '' . during the nobel banquet on <integer> december <year> , hodgkin gave the traditional speech on behalf of the three neurophysiologists , thanking the king and the nobel committee for physiology or medicine for the award . incidentally , hodgkin and his wife attended the nobel prize ceremony a second time , three years later , when hodgkin 's father-in-law , francis peyton rous , was awarded the <year> nobel prize in physiology or medicine . == later career and administrative positions == from <year> to <year> , hodgkin was the foulerton professor of the royal society at cambridge . in <year> he became the john humphrey plummer professor of biophysics at cambridge . around this time he also ended his experiments on nerve at the plymouth marine laboratory and switched his focus to visual research which he could do in cambridge with the help of others while serving as president of the royal society . together with denis baylor and peter detwiler he published a series of papers on turtle photoreceptors . from <year> to <year> hodgkin

paper imperial war museum interview john fraser muth ( ; september <days> , <year> – october <days> , <year> ) was an american economist . he is `` the father of the rational expectations revolution in economics '' , primarily due to his article `` rational expectations and the theory of price movements '' from <year> . muth earned his ph.d. in mathematical economics from carnegie mellon university , and was in <year> the first recipient of the alexander henderson award . he was affiliated with carnegie mellon as a research associate from <year> until <year> , as an assistant professor from <year> to <year> , and as an associate professor without tenure from <year> to <year> . he was a full professor at michigan state university from <year> to <year> and a full professor at indiana university from <year> until his retirement in <year> . muth asserted that expectations `` are essentially the same as the predictions of the relevant economic theory . '' although he formulated the rational expectations principle in the context of microeconomics it has subsequently become associated with macroeconomics and the work of robert lucas , jr. , finn e. kydland , edward c. prescott , neil wallace , thomas j. sargent , and others . == work with holt , modigliani , and simon == two divergent approaches to economic modeling , which have later become cornerstones of modeling of economic systems , originated at the graduate school of industrial administration ( gsia ) at carnegie mellon in the late 1950s and early 1960s . at the same time as john muth was developing the concept of rational expectations , herbert a. simon had been refining his ideas on bounded rationality , emphasizing people 's limited computational abilities . together with their two colleagues at gsia charles c. holt and franco modigliani , muth and simon collaborated on planning production , inventories , and work force ( <year> ) , a book on problems of production scheduling and inventory management for the firm . their goal was to derive tractable , operational rules that could easily be applied in practice . rather than a coincidence that the two apparently contradictory approaches to economic modeling were developed at gsia at the same time , it is more likely that fruitful interaction in the quest to answer a common set of problems led the two researchers to two different solutions . in an earlier work , herb simon had shown that with quadratic costs and under a certain set of assumptions about the probability distributions , optimal decision rules for production and inventories would be linear functions of the variables describing the state . in his model , firms only needed to take into account the expected value and ignore all higher moments of the probability distribution of future sales . this result , known as certainty equivalence , drastically reduces the computational burden on a representative decision maker . simon 's result that decision makers only focus on expected values of stochastic variables was very sensitive to the assumed structure of the problem , hence indirectly on the formulation of expectations . this lack of a general theory of expectations was an unsatisfactory state of affairs and proved to be key in muth 's approach to solve the problem which has often been termed interaction between expectations and reality . in his article from <year> , muth writes : `` to make dynamic economic models complete , various expectational formulas have been used . there is , however , little evidence to suggest that the presumed relations bear a resemblance to the way the economy works . '' == rationalization of friedman 's adaptive expectations model == phillip cagan , milton friedman and others used the ad hoc updating rule which they labeled adaptive expectations to forecast the hidden state y <other> ( e.g. , permanent income ) . in a <year> paper , muth answered the question : for what stochastic process for y will adaptive expectations as postulated by cagan and friedman be the optimal forecast of y <other> . muth 's approach to find recursive optimal linear forecast of a `` hidden '' state vector , x , given an `` observer '' , y is very similar to the kalman filter , presented by rudolf kálmán in his paper from the same year . in his paper `` optimal properties of exponentially weighted forecasts '' , which was published in the journal of the american statistical association in <year> , muth rationalized friedman 's adaptive expectations model for permanent income . he did this by reverse engineering a stochastic process for income for which cagan 's expectation formula equals a mathematical expectation of future values conditioned on the infinite history of past incomes . among muth 's insights was that the stochastic process being forecast should dictate both the distributed lag and the conditioning variables that people use to forecast the future . == hypothesis of rational expectations == in `` rational expectations and the theory of price movements '' , published in <year> , muth put forward his hypothesis , in contrast to simon , that `` expectations , since they are informed predictions of future events , are essentially the same as the predictions of the relevant economic theory . '' muth continued , `` at the risk of confusing this purely descriptive hypothesis with a pronouncement as to what firms ought to do , we call such expectations rational . '' muth 's notion was that the professors [ of economics ] , even if correct in their model of man , could do no better in predicting than could the hog farmer or steelmaker or insurance company . the notion is one of intellectual modesty .... the common sense is `` rationality '' : therefore muth called the argument `` rational expectations '' . == legacy == muth 's works influenced almost every area of economic research into dynamic problems . of course we knew about [ rational expectations ] . muth was a colleague of ours [ in the early 1960s ] . we just did n't think it was important . the hypothesis was more or less buried during the '60s . arrow used it in his paper on learning-by-doing in the '60s . prescott and i used it in that paper of ours on investment . people were aware of it , but i did n't understand then how fundamental a difference it made econometrically . i did n't realize that if you took it seriously you had to rethink the whole question of testing and estimation . i guess no one else did either , except for muth . it must be quite an experience to write papers that radical and have people just pat you on the head and say 'that 's interesting , ' and nothing happens . muth 's role in the history of economics is unusual . like hermann heinrich gossen , he became famous for one idea , he provided the analytical key to developments that , in the jargon of scientific journalism , were described as revolutionary , and he was virtually ignored by his immediate contemporaries . however , whereas gossen had no influence on those developments , his key results being independently rediscovered by jevons and walras , the rational expectations economics of the 1970s and 1980s was a direct outgrowth of muth 's seminal idea . in fact , muth 's contribution is one of the relatively few instances in which there is no indication that the history of economics would have taken about the same course in its absence . it was a novel and ingenious idea , it was not `` in the air , '' and no multiple discovery has yet come to light . == major works == charles c. holt , franco modigliani , john f. muth , and herbert a. simon ( <year> ) . planning production , inventories , and work force . john f. muth .

'' == biko affair == south african anti-apartheid activist steve biko , who had formerly studied medicine at the university of natal medical school , was detained by port elizabeth security police on <integer> august <year> and held for <integer> days . sometime between <integer> and <integer> september <days> biko was beaten and tortured into a coma . according to allegations by ames and others , surgeon ivor lang , along with chief district surgeon benjamin tucker , collaborated with the police and covered up the abuse , leading to biko 's death from his injuries on <integer> september <days> according to benatar & benatar <year> , `` there were clear ethical breaches on the part of the doctors who were responsible '' for biko . when the south african medical and dental council ( samdc ) along with the support of the medical association of south africa ( masa ) , declined to discipline the district surgeons in biko 's death , two groups of physicians filed separate formal complaints with the samdc regarding the lack of professionalism shown by biko 's doctors . both cases made their way to the south african supreme court in an attempt to force the samdc to conduct a formal inquiry into the medical ethics of lang and tucker . one case was filed by ames , along with trefor jenkins and phillip tobias of the university of the witwatersrand ; a second case was filed by dumisani mzana , yosuf veriava of coronationville hospital , and tim wilson of alexandra health centre.as ames and the small group of physicians pursued an inquiry into members of their own profession , ames was called a whistleblower . her position at the university was threatened by her superiors and her colleagues asked her to drop the case . by pursuing the case against the biko doctors , ames received personal threats and risked her safety . baldwin-ragaven et al . note that the medical association `` closed ranks in support of colleagues who colluded with the security police in the torture and death of detainees [ and ] also attempted to silence and discredit those doctors who stood up for human rights and who demanded disciplinary action against their colleagues . `` after eight years , ames won the case in <year> when the south african supreme court ruled in her favor . with ames ' help , the case forced the medical regulatory body to reverse their decision . the two doctors who treated biko were finally disciplined and major medical reforms followed . according to benatar & benatar <year> , the case `` played an important role in sensitising the medical profession to medical ethical issues in south africa . '' == cannabis research == ames studied the effects of cannabis in <year> , publishing her work in the british journal of psychiatry as `` a clinical and metabolic study of acute intoxication with cannabis sativa and its role in the model psychoses '' . her work is cited extensively throughout the cannabis literature . she opposed the war on drugs and was a proponent of the therapeutic benefits of cannabis , particularly for people with multiple sclerosis ( ms ) . ames observed first-hand how cannabis ( known as dagga in south africa ) relieved spasm in ms patients and helped paraplegics in the spinal injuries ward of her hospital . she continued to study the effects of cannabis in the 1990s , publishing several articles about cannabis-induced euphoria and the effects of cannabis on the brain . == personal life == ames was married to editorial writer david castle of the cape times and they had four sons . she was <integer> years old when her husband died unexpectedly in <year> . after her husband 's death , ames 's housekeeper rosalina helped raise the family . ames wrote about the experience in her memoir , mothering in an apartheid society ( <year> ) . == death == ames struggled with leukemia for some time . before her death , she told an interviewer , `` i shall go on until i drop .

the article was titled `` discovered : the monarch 's mexican haven '' and featured a cover photograph of trail covered with butterflies . a dozen such sites are now known in mexico ; they are protected as ecological preserves by the mexican government . the area is now a world heritage site known as the monarch butterfly biosphere reserve . current conservation efforts are aimed at protecting monarchs in their breeding areas in the us and canada.among other discoveries , the urquharts learned that the butterflies only travel in daylight and can fly up to <integer> kilometres ( <integer> mi ) in a day . the trip north spans several generations of monarchs , while a much-longer-lived `` super generation '' flies from the northern reaches of the butterfly 's range all the way to mexico , overwinters there , and breeds in the spring to start the next generation flying north . == education and career == urquhart was born in toronto on december <days> , <year> . as a child he was fascinated by insects , particularly monarch butterflies , and he wondered where they went during the winter . he attended the university of toronto , graduating in <year> with a degree in biology . he received an ma in <year> and a phd in <year> . during world war ii he taught meteorology to students in the royal canadian air force . following the war he began work as a zoology professor at the university of toronto and a zoology director at the royal ontario museum . he helped to found the federation of ontario naturalists . in <year> he helped to organize and teach the zoology program at scarborough college , now the university of toronto scarborough , retiring in <year> . he was a popular lecturer and produced a highly successful television lecture series . he wrote four books , a monograph , and <integer> papers in peer-reviewed journals , as well as numerous scientific reports and popular articles . his best known books are the monarch butterfly ( university of toronto press , <year> ) and the monarch butterfly : international traveler ( university of toronto press , <year> ) .on july <days> , <year> , he married norah roden patterson , who became his full collaborator in butterfly research , although she did not have a ph.d . they had one son . fred urquhart died november <days> , <year> at the age of <integer> . norah urquhart died in pickering on march <days> , <year> at the age of <integer> . == recognition == in <year> fred and norah urquart were presented with canada 's highest civilian award , the order of canada . they received the w.w.h . gunn award presented by the federation of ontario naturalists . the urquhart butterfly garden in dundas , ontario is a <other> park designed to attract butterflies.an imax film , flight of the butterflies , tells the story of the long search by the urquharts , brugger , and trail to unlock the secret of the butterflies ' migration.in <year> , the episode `` butterfly babies '' in elinor wonders why was released with a song about the urquharts as depicted as bunnies . == references == == external links == flight of the butterflies monarch watch santuario de la mariposa monarca universidad michoacana fred urquhart oral history interview held at the university of toronto archives and records management services edward butts lewis ( may <days> , <year> – july <days> , <year> ) was an american geneticist , a corecipient of the <year> nobel prize in physiology or medicine . he helped to found the field of evolutionary developmental biology . == early life == lewis was born in wilkes-barre , pennsylvania , the second son of laura mary lewis ( née histed ) and edward butts lewis , a watchmaker-jeweler . his full name was supposed to be edward butts lewis jr. , but his birth certificate was incorrectly filled out with `` b . '' as his middle name.lewis graduated from e. l. meyers high school . == education and career == he received a ba in biostatistics from the university of minnesota in <year> , where he worked on drosophila melanogaster in the lab of c.p . oliver . in <year> lewis received a phd from california institute of technology ( caltech ) , working under the guidance of alfred sturtevant . in <year> , edward b. lewis arrived at caltech and finished his phd within three years . lewis enrolled in the u.s. army air corps training program in meteorology in <year> and later received his masters in the area a year later . as he left for military service in <year> , he was told by the university president robert a. millikan that he had a position as an instructor at caltech when he returned . he served working mostly as a weather forecaster in hawaii and okinawa for four years . lewis returned in <year> and took his position at caltech where his duties included helping in the laboratory for an introductory genetics course . he was promoted in <year> to a professor and became the thomas hunt morgan professor of biology in <year> . == personal life == in <year> , edward b. lewis met pamela harrah ( 1925–2018 ) . she was an accomplished artist , but also shared lewis ' interests in animal life . she had went to stanford and studied genetics and later discovered the mutant polycomb , that now is important in the understanding of gene regulation . they married and had three sons named glenn , hugh , and keith . pam developed an infection that caused her to have a visual and physical , partial unilateral paralysis , which limited her mobility.lewis maintained a constant exercise routine in his day , as he started his mornings with breakfast and exercise , until he suffered from cancer . lewis would normally have lunch with his faculty members at the anthenaeum , then take a nap and return to the laboratory in the evening . the most constant part of his daily routine was that he would do most of his work at night . he also enjoyed playing the flute and would allow himself to have time to play the flute at night . in addition , lewis appreciated other aspects of life even though they interrupted his typical schedule . some other things he did with his time include : jogging , swimming , playing on the beach , playing chamber music with friends , going to see movies , and attending opera performances . edward b. lewis was a humble man who did not always receive attention for his works . over time , his work with drosophila became more appreciated and he began to attract more attention . == career and research == his nobel prize–winning studies with drosophila , ( including the discovery of the drosophila bithorax complex of homeotic genes , and elucidation of its function ) , founded the field of evolutionary developmental biology and laid the groundwork for our current understanding of the universal , evolutionarily conserved strategies controlling animal development . he is credited with development of the complementation test . his key publications in the fields of genetics , developmental biology , radiation and cancer are presented in the book genes , development and cancer , which was released in <year> . during the 1950s , lewis studied the effects of radiation from x-rays , nuclear fallout and other sources as possible causes of cancer . he reviewed medical records from survivors of the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki , as well as radiologists and patients exposed to x-rays . lewis concluded that `` health risks from radiation had been underestimated '' . lewis published articles in science and other journals and made a presentation to a congressional committee on atomic energy in 1957.at the scientific level of the debate , the crucial question was whether the `` threshold theory '' was valid or whether , as lewis insisted , the effects of radioactivity were `` linear with no threshold '' , where every exposure to radiation had a long-term cumulative effect.the issue of linearity versus threshold re-entered the debate on nuclear fallout in <year> , when ernest sternglass , a pittsburgh physicist , argued that the linearity thesis was confirmed by the research of alice stewart .

' == affiliations == lenneberg was quite involved in the scientific community , as he was a member of phi beta kappa , sigma xi , the linguistic society of america , the american psychological association , the society for research in child development , and the american association for the advancement of science . == education == he attended primary school in düsseldorf , germany until <year> , when he moved to brazil . in <year> , he received a b.a . from the university of chicago . lenneberg then went on to earn a ph.d. in psychology and linguistics from harvard in <year> . == references == == bibliography == biological foundations of language . new york : john wiley & sons , <year> . isbn <days> the capacity of language acquisition in fodor and katz , <year> . fodor , jerry and jerrold katz , eds . <year> . the structure of language . englewood cliffs , nj : prentice hall . the fodor & katz volume is a collection of papers around early chomskyan linguistics , phonology , grammar , semantics . george hines lowery jr. ( october <days> , <year> – january <days> , <year> ) was an american ornithologist and professor of zoology at louisiana state university , who pioneered a technique for studying nocturnal bird migration by large-scale observation through telescopes across the united states of america of flocks of birds as they flew at night in front of the face of the moon . george was born in monroe , louisiana , where his parents encouraged an interest in the natural world . he studied at louisiana polytechnic institute in ruston from <year> to <year> when he moved to the louisiana state university at baton rouge . he received a bs in <year> and an ms in <year> . he worked for a while as an instructor and was assistant curator of the museum of zoology . he received a phd from the university of kansas in <year> and returned to become a professor . in <year> he was made boyd professor of zoology . he published louisiana birds in <year> which won the louisiana literary award . he also made collection trips , some funded by the mcilhenny family , and he collaborated with josselyn van tyne . his phd students included thomas raymond howell.his most famous contribution to ornithology was a technique he developed along with the astronomer w.a . rense to study nocturnal migration . they recruited a number of amateur astronomers to collaborate and produce quantitative estimates of bird migration by direct observation . this was his doctoral research topic and he developed it with his students s. a. gauthreaux and robert j. newman . he received the brewster award of the american ornithologists union for this work in 1956.the long-whiskered owlet ( xenoglaux loweryi ) and gerrhonotus liocephalus loweryi , a subspecies of alligator lizard , are named in his honor .

professor . during the presidency of jimmy carter , huntington was the white house coordinator of security planning for the national security council . during the 1980s apartheid era in south africa , he served as an adviser to p. w. botha 's security services . he is best known for his <year> theory , the `` clash of civilizations '' , of a post-cold war new world order . he argued that future wars would be fought not between countries , but between cultures , and that islamic extremism would become the biggest threat to western domination of the world . huntington is credited with helping to shape american views on civilian-military relations , political development , and comparative government . according to the open syllabus project , huntington is the second most frequently cited author on college syllabi for political science courses . == early life and education == huntington was born on april <days> , <year> , in new york city , the son of dorothy sanborn ( née phillips ) , a short-story writer , and richard thomas huntington , a publisher of hotel trade journals . his grandfather was publisher john sanborn phillips . he graduated with distinction from yale university at

<integer> . == academic career == huntington was a member of harvard 's department of government from <year> until he was denied tenure in <year> . along with zbigniew brzezinski , who had also been denied tenure , he moved to columbia university in new york . from <year> to <year> he was an associate professor of government at columbia , where he was also associate director of their institute of

<year> . huntington and warren demian manshel co-founded and co-edited foreign policy . huntington stayed as co-editor until 1977.huntington 's first major book was the soldier and the state : the theory and politics of civil-military relations ( <year> ) , which was highly controversial when it was published , but presently is regarded as the most influential book on american civil-military relations . he became prominent with his political order in changing societies ( <year> ) , a work that challenged the conventional opinion of modernization theorists , that economic and social progress would produce stable democracies in recently decolonized countries . he also was co-author of the crisis of democracy : on the governability of democracies , a report issued by the trilateral commission in <year> . in <year> , his friend brzezinski – who had been appointed national security adviser in the administration of jimmy carter – invited huntington to become white house coordinator

life == huntington met his wife , nancy arkelyan , when they were working together on a speech for <year> presidential candidate adlai stevenson . they had two sons , nicholas and timothy.after several years of declining health , huntington died on december <days> , <year> , at age <integer> on martha 's vineyard , massachusetts . == notable arguments == === the soldier and the state === in the soldier and the state : the theory and politics of civil-military relations ( <year> ) huntington presents a general theory of civil–military relations . huntington proposes a theory of objective civilian control , according to which the optimal means of asserting control over the armed forces is to professionalize them . === political order in changing societies === during <year> , just as the united states ' war in vietnam was becoming most intense , huntington published political order in changing societies , which was a critique of the modernization theory which had affected much us policy regarding the developing world during the prior decade . huntington argues that as societies modernize , they become more complex and disordered . if the process of social modernization that produces this disorder is not matched by a process of political and institutional modernization—a process which produces political institutions capable of managing the stress of modernization—the result may <days> violence . during the 1970s , huntington was an advisor to governments , both democratic and dictatorial . during <year> , he met with medici government representatives in brazil ; a year later he published the report `` approaches to political decompression '' , warning against the risks of a too-rapid political liberalization , proposing gradual liberalization , and a strong party state modeled upon the image of the mexican institutional revolutionary party . after a prolonged transition , brazil became democratic during <year> . during the 1980s , he became a valued adviser to the south african regime , which used his ideas on political order to craft its `` total strategy '' to reform apartheid and suppress growing resistance . he assured south africa 's rulers that increasing the repressive power of the state ( which at that time included police violence , detention without trial , and torture ) can be necessary to effect reform . the reform process , he told his south african audience , often requires `` duplicity , deceit , faulty assumptions and purposeful blindness . '' he thus gave his imprimatur to his hosts ' project of `` reforming '' apartheid rather than eliminating it.huntington frequently cited brazil as a success , alluding to his role in his <year> presidential address to the american political science association , commenting that political science played a modest role in this process . critics , such as british political scientist alan hooper , note that contemporary brazil has an especially unstable party system , wherein the best institutionalized party , luiz inácio lula da silva 's workers ' party , emerged in opposition to controlled transition . moreover , hooper claims that the lack of civil participation in contemporary brazil results from that top-down process of political participation transitions . === the third wave === in his <year> book the third wave : democratization in the late twentieth century , huntington made the argument that beginning with portugal 's revolution during <year> , there has been a third wave of democratization which describes a global trend which includes more than <integer> countries throughout europe , latin america , asia , and africa which have undergone some form of democratic transition . huntington won the <year> university of louisville grawemeyer award for this book . === `` the clash of civilizations '' === during <year> , huntington provoked great debate among international relations theorists with the interrogatively titled `` the clash of civilizations ? `` , an influential , oft-cited article published in foreign affairs magazine . in the article , he argued that , after the fall of the soviet union , islam would become the biggest obstacle to western domination of the world . the west 's next big war therefore , he said , would inevitably be with islam . its description of post-cold war geopolitics and the `` inevitability of instability '' contrasted with the influential `` end of history '' thesis advocated by francis fukuyama . huntington expanded `` the clash of civilizations ? '' to book length and published it as the clash of civilizations and the remaking of world order in <year> . the article and the book posit that post-cold war conflict would most frequently and violently occur because of cultural rather than ideological differences . that , whilst in the cold war , conflict occurred between the capitalist west and the communist bloc east , it now was most likely to occur between the world 's major civilizations—identifying seven , and a possible eighth : ( i ) western , ( ii ) latin american , ( iii ) islamic , ( iv ) sinic ( chinese ) , ( v ) hindu , ( vi ) orthodox , ( vii ) japanese , and ( viii ) african . this cultural organization contrasts the contemporary world with the classical notion of sovereign states . to understand current and future conflict , cultural rifts must be understood , and culture—rather than the state—must be accepted as the reason for war . thus , western nations will lose predominance if they fail to recognize the irreconcilable nature of cultural tensions . huntington argued that this post-cold war shift in geopolitical organization and structure requires the west to strengthen itself culturally , by abandoning the imposition of its ideal of democratic universalism and its incessant military interventionism . underscoring this point , huntington wrote in the <year> expansion , `` in the emerging world of ethnic conflict and civilizational clash , western belief in the universality of western culture suffers three problems : it is false ; it is immoral ; and it is dangerous . `` the identification of western civilization with western christianity ( catholic-protestant ) was not huntington 's original idea , it was rather the traditional western opinion and subdivision before the cold war era . critics ( for example articles in le monde diplomatique ) call the clash of civilizations and the remaking of world order the theoretical legitimization of american-caused western aggression against china and the world 's islamic and orthodox cultures . other critics argue that huntington 's taxonomy is simplistic and arbitrary , and does not take account of the internal dynamics and partisan tensions within civilizations . furthermore , critics argue that huntington neglects ideological mobilization by elites and unfulfilled socioeconomic needs of the population as the real causal factors driving conflict , that he ignores conflicts that do not fit well with the civilizational borders identified by him , and they charge that his new paradigm is nothing but realist thinking in which `` states '' became replaced by `` civilizations '' . huntington 's influence upon us policy has been likened to that of historian arnold toynbee 's controversial religious theories about asian leaders during the early twentieth century . the new york times obituary on huntington states that his `` emphasis on ancient religious empires , as opposed to states or ethnicities , [ as sources of global conflict ] gained ... more cachet after the sept. <integer> attacks . `` huntington wrote that ukraine might divide along the cultural line between the more catholic western ukraine and orthodox eastern ukraine : while a statist approach highlights the possibility of a russian-ukrainian war , a civilizational approach minimizes that and instead highlights the possibility of ukraine splitting in half , a separation which cultural factors would lead one to predict might be more violent than that of czechoslovakia but far less bloody than that of yugoslavia . === who are we and immigration === huntington 's last book , who are we ? the challenges to america 's national identity , was published <days> may <year> . its subject is the meaning of american national identity and what he describes as a cultural threat from large-scale immigration by latinos , which huntington says could `` divide the united states into two peoples , two cultures , and two languages '' . in this book , he called for america to force immigrants to `` adopt english '' and the us to turn to `` protestant religions '' to `` save itself against the threats '' of latino and islamic immigrants . in a book review for the academic journal perspectives on politics , gary m. segura , dean of the ucla school of public affairs , asserted that the book should not be considered social science because of its divisive views and rhetoric . segura also called huntington 's writing of the book unforgivable on account of huntington 's academic position , saying that the work was a polemic rather than a work of scholarship . === other === huntington is credited with inventing the phrase davos man , referring to global elites who `` have little need for national loyalty , view national boundaries as obstacles that thankfully are vanishing , and see national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the elite 's global operations '' . the phrase refers to the world economic forum in davos , switzerland , where leaders of the global economy meet.during the 1980s , the south african apartheid government of p. w. botha became increasingly preoccupied with security . on huntington 's advice , botha 's government established a powerful state security apparatus to `` protect '' the state against an anticipated upsurge in political violence that the reforms were expected to cause . the 1980s became a period of considerable political unrest , with the government becoming increasingly dominated by botha 's circle of generals and police chiefs ( known as securocrats ) , who managed the various states of emergencies . == national academy of sciences controversy == in <year> , huntington was nominated for membership to the national academy of sciences . the nomination was opposed by serge lang , a yale university mathematician inspired by the writings of mathematician neal koblitz , who had accused huntington of misusing mathematics and engaging in pseudo-science . lang claimed that huntington distorted the historical record and used pseudo-mathematics to make his conclusions seem convincing . lang 's campaign succeeded ; huntington was twice nominated and twice rejected . a detailed description of these events was published by lang in `` academia , journalism , and politics : a case study : the huntington case '' which occupies the first <integer> pages of his <year> book challenges.huntington 's prominence as a harvard professor and director of harvard 's center for international affairs led to significant media coverage of his defeated nomination to the nas , including by the new york times and the new republic . his supporters included herbert a. simon , a <year> laureate of the nobel prize in economics . the mathematical intelligencer offered simon and koblitz an opportunity to engage in a written debate , which they accepted . == selected publications == “ national policy and the transoceanic navy. ” united stats naval institute proceedings <integer> , <integer> <days> may <year> ) : <other> online the soldier and the state : the theory and politics of civil-military relations ( <year> ) the common defense : strategic programs in national politics ( <year> ) political order in changing societies ( <year> ) the crisis of democracy : on the governability of democracies with michel crozier and joji watanuki ( <year> ) political power : usa ussr - similarities and contrasts , convergence or evolution with zbigniew brzezinski ( <year> ) american politics : the promise of disharmony ( <year> ) `` democracy 's third wave .

<days> , <year> – october <days> , <year> ) was a soviet engineer and a prominent rocketry pioneer , best remembered for the failures in the soviet space program that took place under his leadership . mishin was born in byvalino , in the bogorodsky uyezd of the moscow governorate of the russian empire , and studied mathematics at the moscow aviation institute.mishin was a soviet rocket scientist and one of the first soviet specialists to see nazi germany 's <other> facilities at the end of world war ii , along with others such as sergey korolev , who preceded him as the <other> design bureau head , and valentin glushko , who succeeded him.mishin worked with korolev as his deputy in the experimental design bureau working on projects such as the development of the first soviet icbm as well in the sputnik and vostok programs . he became head of korolev 's <other> design bureau and was the chief designer after korolev 's death in <year> , during surgery to remove a tumor from korolev 's colon . he inherited the n1 rocket program , intended to land a man on the moon , but which turned out to be fatally flawed ( largely due to lack of adequate funding ) . n1 development began on september <days> , <year> , a decade before mishin took control . it was selected for a lunar landing mission , which required a design capable of putting ninety-five tons of cargo into orbit , up from fifty and later seventy-five ton requirements earlier in development . under korolev , a precedent of forgoing much of the usual ground testing had been begun . according to korolev , this was because proper facilities would not be funded , and it would also allow for earlier test flights . some of the failures mishin faced during his leadership could have been avoided if further testing had been conducted at this stage . to handle engine failures , the kord system was created under mishin . to prevent the rocket from having uneven flight that would result from the unbalanced thrust caused by a malfunctioning motor , the faulty motor and the motor opposite it in the rocket base would be turned off . kord would also make the calculations necessary to compensate for the missing motors , which would allow the same flight path to be maintained.the n1 , despite its necessity for planned missions , was never successfully flown . the first test flight , on february <days> , <year> , had internal plumbing issues which led to a fire one minute in . it did , however , demonstrate the kord system working successfully as well as proper deployment of the ejection safety system . the second launch , on july <days> , experienced failure seconds after ignition , causing the rocket to fall back on the launchpad and create significant damage . the third n1 launch occurred on june <days> , <year> , after improvements were made to kord , the cabling , and fuel pumps , and the addition of an extinguishment system and filters . before the launch , the individual engines were further tested and the launchpad was repaired . for the first time all thirty engines of the first stage fired successfully , which was the cause of the failure of the flight . when all engines fired together , it created unexpectedly high roll ( rotation along the axis of thrust ) , which was beyond the strength of the compensating vernier engines , designed to keep stable flight . this was another failure that might have been prevented with proper ground testing.for the fourth and what would become the final flight of the n1 , further refinements were made , including four additional vernier engines , additional heat shielding for internal components , a new digital control system , and additional sensors paired with a high speed relay system . the soviet space program was now eyeing creating a base on the moon , but first needed to finally succeed with this design . the launch was on november <days> , <year> , with a mishin approved flight plan to orbit the moon forty-two times , with flight activities such as taking pictures of future landing sites , before returning to earth on december <days> . the rocket preceded farther than its predecessors , but shortly before the first stage was to separate one engine caught fire , causing the entire structure to explode , but not before the escape system activated.despite his skills in rocketry , mishin was not known as an able administrator . he is often blamed for the failure of the program to put a man on the moon , and faced criticisms for his alcohol consumption . he was described by soviet premier nikita khrushchev as `` not [ having ] the slightest idea how to cope with the many thousands of people , the management of whom had been loaded onto his shoulders , nor make the huge irreversible government machine work for him . `` <days> may <year> , yuri gagarin and alexei leonov criticised mishin 's `` poor knowledge of the soyuz spacecraft and the details of its operation , his lack of cooperation in working with the cosmonauts in flight and training activities '' and asked nikolai kamanin for him to be cited in the official report into the soyuz <integer> crash , which killed vladimir komarov . leonov described mishin as `` hesitant , uninspiring , poor at making decisions , over-reluctant to take risks and bad at managing the cosmonaut corps '' other failures during his term of leadership were the deaths of the soyuz <integer> crew , the loss of three space stations , and computer failures in four probes sent to mars.on may <days> , <year> , while he was in the hospital , mishin was replaced by a rival , chief engine designer valentin glushko , after all four n1 test launches failed.he continued his educational and research works as the head of rocket department of moscow aviation institute . vasily mishin was awarded the title hero of socialist labor for his work with the soviet space program.he died in moscow on october <days> , <year> at the age of 84.his diaries , containing information on the program from <year> to <year> , were purchased by the perot foundation in <year> . in <year> a small part of the collection was donated to the national air and space

research center in nazi germany . after his return from the soviet union where he had forcibly worked for rocketry development under the operation osoaviakhim until <year> he became an east german party official . during the later 1950s , he was increasingly involved in economic policy , serving from <year> as head of the politburo 's economics commission . he was seen as a reformer . however , economic reform rapidly fell off the agenda after october <year> when nikita khrushchev fell from power in moscow.apel served as president of the state planning commission between <year> and <year> . his final project was to negotiate a trade deal with the soviet union . however , hours before he was due to sign the resulting agreement on behalf of the east german government , he committed suicide by firearm . == life == === early years === erich hans apel was born in judenbach , a small town in the franconian forest which had once benefited from its position as a staging post on a major trade route , but which had lost out commercially following the construction of a railway line providing a direct link from leipzig to nuremberg . apel 's father was a mechanical engineer : his mother worked in the garments industry . he attended school in nearby sonneberg and steinach , but left school in <year> in order to embark on an apprenticeship at the neuhaus porcelain factory in toolmaking and mechanical engineering . the ruling nazi party was popular in the region and in <year> he joined the deutsches jungvolk youth organisation . however , it was found that the sixteen year old disrupted the `` mind-numbingly dull drill exercises '' ( `` der stumpfsinnige drill '' ) , and he was thrown out after nine months because of his `` negative attitude '' to the quasi-military exercises in which the boys were expected to participate . after completing his apprenticeship in <year> he stayed on at the neuhaus factory as a toolmaker and designer till <year> . then , between <year> and <year> , he attended the engineering academy at nearby ilmenau , emerging with a degree in mechanical engineering . === war years === directly after receiving his degree , <days> september <year> apel was conscripted into the army , becoming a member of infantry reserve battalion <integer> , based in gotha . around this time world war ii broke out . however , on <integer> december <year> apel was ordered to the weapons agency 's research facility at peenemünde on germany 's northern coast . the head of the facility was the charismatic rocketry expert , wernher von braun . apel seems to have been in his element . a contemporary later recalled that he worked from 07.30 till 17.30 , like everyone else , but then in the evenings he retreated to his bedroom in a nearby hostel , in order to work on proposals for improvements . his speciality was the hydraulic systems for the rockets . he was tireless in his work of calculation , measuring and modelling . he seems to have made a good impression , since <days> august <year> he was relieved of all further obligations regarding military service . <days> november <year> he was appointed to the position of plant engineer and assistant to the facility director . he was totally uninterested in politics , never joining the party , and regarded by colleagues as a dedicated engineer , body and soul.3 october <year> was apel 's twenty-fifth birthday . coincidentally , he was able to spent the day as a witness to the first launch anywhere in the world of a long-distance rocket , the so-called ( at this stage ) a4 . the launch took place at 16.00 and everything worked perfectly , the rocket attaining a speed of mach 4.5 , a height of <integer> kilometres ( <integer> mi ) , and a horizontal distance of <integer> kilometres ( <integer> mi ) . at the start of <year> apel was promoted again , despite his young age becoming head of one of the many development departments at the peenemünde army research facility . shortly after this he mentioned to as group of colleagues what a wretched business it was that the thing should explode in the middle of a city . his boss , walter thiel , came to hear of the comment and called him aside , `` apel , you should have joined the medical service : you 're too soft for the work here '' . however , there is no indication that apel 's comment adversely affected his career prospects : the researchers at peenemünde saw themselves as an elite team engaged in vital work , and the only realistic alternative career path would have led him back to the military frontline.during <year> it became clear that the british knew about the research facility at peenemünde . with their us allies they launched a succession of bombing raids to destroy it , starting <days> august <year> . most of the <integer> people killed at peenemünde in the first bombing raid , on <integer> august <days> were forced labourers , but the dead also included erich apel 's boss , walter thiel and his family . by that time , however , apel himself was far away , transferred <days> april <year> with his own team of assembly specialists and administrators to the linke-hofmann-werke ( lhw ) plant in breslau ( as wrocław was known ) before <year> ) . breslau was traditionally a centre for railway production and lhw was traditionally a manufacturer of railway locomotives and rolling stock , but during the war its sophisticated engineering capabilities were also being adapted to produce components and sub-assemblies for the rocket , which government propaganda was by now identifying as the `` vergeltungswaffe <integer> '' ( `` retribution weapon <integer> '' / <other> ) . as the continuing bombing raids at the peenemünde army research center had their effect through <year> and <year> , the lhw plant became the assembly location for the <other> rockets . in <integer> april <year> , at the request of the lhw management , erich apel was released from his employment contract with the army high command weapons agency . he was now employed directly as chief engineer and assistant to the technical director at lhw.by the end of <year> the war was coming home to germany . lhw now outsourced <other> rocket production to a firm called `` peterbau gmbh '' in kleinbodungen near nordhausen . with the assembly contract they sent erich apel , who with effect from january <year> became technical director of peterbau gmbh . apel 's resolute determination to avoid politics now seemed to catch up with him , since the new location for rocket assembly was part of the vast underground factory at the mittelbau-dora concentration camp . conditions were so dreadful that at least one commentator has suggested that the <other> rockets found more victims among the slave labourers engaged in constructing the underground factory and in working on the rockets than among the citizens of london , the intended target of the finished rockets . even if erich apel had nothing to do with setting up and running the vast deadly forced labour infrastructure , as the engineer responsible for the rockets he was naturally associated with it . as nazi germany collapsed militarily and politically during the first part of <year> , apel succeeded in getting back to his home village of judenbach . like millions of his compatriots he was determined to make a clean break with the past . === soviet occupation zone === war ended , formally , <days> may <year> . the entire southern region of germany had been liberated by the united states army , but the victorious powers had already agreed a partition of the western two thirds of the country into four military occupation zones . after the americans had withdrawn to their agreed positions judenbach was included in the middle portion of germany that would now be administered as the soviet occupation zone . initially apel worked on the local farms . on <integer> january <year> he enrolled on the `` new teachers '' programme . with millions of working age germans dead or in prison of war camps , there was a desperate shortage of teachers , and the scheme , implemented with varying levels of effectiveness in the various occupation zones , was designed to select those appropriately educated individuals who were thought to be not excessively tainted by nazi involvement , to undergo a rapid `` re-education '' and set to work educating school-age children . at the same time he both studied and taught , till <integer> may <year> , at the professional business academy in nearby steinach.in january <year> erich apel joined a political party , choosing the centre-left social democratic party ( `` sozialdemokratische partei deutschlands '' / spd ) . four months later , the spd merged with the communist party to form the new socialist unity party ( `` sozialistische einheitspartei deutschlands '' / sed ) . the merger was presented as a way to prevent divisions on the political left from opening up opportunities for right wing populists to take control as had happened after <year> . in reality it never took effect except in the soviet zone , where it received sustained practical backing from the military administration . the political development was not one for which apel could muster much enthusiasm , and in common with many spd members he was not one of those `` volunteering '' to sign his party membership over to the new party ( though he was accepted as a member of the sed , eleven years later , in <year> ) . === work in the soviet union === on <integer> june <year> apel was `` picked up '' by the soviet authorities . they showed no interest in his association with forced labour at the underground rocket factory at mittelbau-dora . but they were nevertheless interested in the factory ; and they did make him an offer which , for a range of practical reasons , he was almost certainly in no position to refuse . the soviets invited him to work with them as chief engineer and representative of the ( former ) factory management at the soviet technical commission in the bleicherode quarter of nordhausen ( which had also ended up in the soviet zone ) , adjacent to the vast underground rocket plant.soviet interest in the german rocket programme was fully shared by the united states . during the chaotic closing weeks of the war wernher von braun had traveled to nordhausen and met with apel , offering to take him to america after the military defeat which by now everyone saw as inevitable . von braun was keen , as far as possible , to keep his full team with him . but his specialist in rocket hydraulics turned him down . apel did not want to volunteer for further work in the weapons industry.on <integer> october <year> , across the soviet occupation zone , in the early hours of the morning technicians and engineers from the rocket project were visited by soviet officers , each accompanied by a translator . a brief instruction was read out : `` by order of the soviet military administration you must work for five years in the soviet union . you can take your wife and family with you , and as many of your personal effects as you wish ... '' . till now apel 's working life had involved living in guest houses or barracks so he did not have many personal effects . just hours after the order was given apel and his colleagues were on the train heading east as part of operation osoaviakhim . the mood on the train was dark and apprehensive . the journey took around <integer> days . their ultimate destination was an island in the middle of lake seliger in a sparsely inhabited marshy region some <integer> kilometres ( <integer> mi ) northwest of moscow.before crossing to the island apel was taken to podlipki ( today korolyov ) where he was reunited with a large quantity of heavy machinery and equipment that he had last seen in germany during the closing weeks of the war . the german invasion of the soviet union in <year> had forced the soviets to build up an impressive expertise in deconstructing factories and their equipment , crating them up , and relocating them by train to places beyond the reach of the german army . after the war they had taken the opportunity to perfect their skills , crating up surviving german factories and their equipment , and taking them to the soviet union by way of war reparations . the <year> opel kadett turned up in <year> as the soviet built moskvitch <integer> . they had also applied their skill to the rocket facility in the mountain . the red army had used <integer> railway wagons to carry away 5,647 tonnes of machinery , munitions , and partially constructed rockets . by the end of <year> a further 2,270 railway wagons had transported another 14,256 rocket construction plant , partially constructed rockets , and specialist machinery from the former nazi facility in the soviet occupation zone to a new rocket research facility in the soviet union . secrecy was so complete that ten years later the world still believed that soviet rocket programme was based on soviet rocket science . the americans had taken away only <integer> tonnes of `` rocket materials '' from the nordhausen facility . after inspecting the soviet hoard , erich apel joined his colleagues on the island of gorodomlya.keeping the german workers on an island helped enforce the secrecy , but the german experts nevertheless received wages twice as high as those of their soviet counterparts . erich apel became head of a testing department . seventy years later a colleague from those times remembered him as `` sociable , but also a little distant . not so proletarian , and always a bit 'the boss ' '' ( `` '' er war gesellig , aber auch ein bisschen distanziert . nicht so proletenhaft , immer auch ein bisschen 'der chef ' '' ) . there was no attempt to integrate the germans into the soviet research teams . stalin never intended that they should remain permanently . the idea was to `` milk '' their knowledge till their soviet counterparts had absorbed all the necessary knowledge . that point was reached by the end of <year> , after which the germans on the island were restricted to `` theoretical '' research . that suited apel well enough . he had found a new wife , christa metzner , the daughter of a german aircraft engineer from the arado aircraft plant. , whom he married in gorodomlya . information on his first marriage remains in short supply : christa apel said later that she believed erich had married an austrian woman around <year> , but the first marriage had ended in divorce because apel 's war work meant he was almost always away . it was frequently indicated that during his six years in the soviet union erich apel became a communist , but in his bones it seems reasonable to conclude that he remained a political agnostic . === german democratic republic === erich apel returned on <integer> june <year> . the soviet occupation zone had been relaunched <days> october <year> as the soviet sponsored german democratic republic ( east germany ) . there was no call , in east germany , for specialist expertise in weapons and rocketry . other branches of heavy industry remained in place , however . just four months after getting back , erich apel was working as a chief engineer and department head at the east german ministry for machinery construction . promotion to a technical directorship followed <days> april <year> . <days> november <year> he became a deputy minister in the department , working under heinrich rau.he owed his rapid advancement in the new state to its leader , walter ulbricht . after years under military occupation which in many ways placed soviet well-being ahead of german reconstruction , ulbricht had narrowly survived the <year> uprising and was now keen to demonstrate that under soviet sponsorship it was possible to create in east germany a fully functioning socialist state . for that he needed technical experts and talented administrators . apel was both . an important political ally and sponsor was fritz selbmann . after his six years in the soviet union , apel ( like selbmann ) , was a convinced proponent of a `` planned economy '' . the choice was one between `` rationalty '' ( vernunft ) and `` chaos '' . it was already apparent that in west germany free market capitalism was giving rise to far more rapid economic growth than anything happening in east germany . the lesson to be drawn was that economic planning had to be undertaken competently and in microscopic detail by the government . political leadership was needed.in june <year> , already a junior government minister , apel became a candidate for party membership . membership was granted <days> march <year> . slightly more than one year later , <days> july <year> , he became a candidate for central committee membership . <days> july <year> erich apel became one of approximately <integer> members of the powerful party central committee . under the leninist constitutional structure in place , the central committee exercised a far tighter degree of control than government ministers or the national parliament ( volkskammer ) . it was therefore by most reckoning a promotion when on <integer> february <year> erich apel resigned his ministerial position and accepted a position as head of the newly created economic commission of the central committee 's politburo . in <year> he also became a member of the volkskammer , in which capacity he chaired the parliamentary economic committee.the economic challenges facing east germany were already formidable by <year> . the mandate walter ulbricht gave to the new economic commission was summed up in the mantra which the leader liked to repeat . east germany should `` overtake without catching up '' ( `` überholen ohne einzuholen '' ) . east germans must be able to eat more butter and meat than west germans . one day they must be able to travel in faster cars and live in better apartments . this must be accomplished without having to copy `` capitalist production methods '' . erich apel must make it happen , not `` someday ... never '' , but by creating and following a plan . if it was a dream , it was a dream in which many comrades evidently believed . <days> july <year> apel was promoted to candidate membership of the politburo and secretaryship of the central committee . there were other appointments which combined to stress his importance in the wider government project . in <year> he received a doctorate in return for a dissertation on the so-called east german chemistry programme.the `` chemistry programme '' was a seven-year plan , launched in <year> under the widely communicated motto `` chemistry gives us bread , welfare and beauty '' ( `` chemie gibt brot , wohlstand und schönheit '' ) , and designed to double chemicals production by <year> , making it the country 's second largest industrial sector after mechanical engineering . the project was closely identified with erich apel , whose intellectual brilliance marked him , and the project , out for success . but reality got in the way of the targets . reparations extracted by the soviets had bled the country of its capacity to rebuild and maintain the infrastructure necessary to support the east german government 's economic aspirations . cut off by international political rivalries from western and world markets , the nation continued to be dependent on deliveries of vital raw materials from the soviet union , and the partnership with the soviets , even at the height of the cold war , was far less fraternal than would have been assumed at the time in the west . recently discovered documents indicate that even in <year> moscow agreed to deliver to the german democratic republic only around half the raw materials which the east german economic plan for <other> called for . one solution was to try and select trading partners according to commercial criteria and not purely according to political dogma . the economic blockade dividing east germany from the west was largely self-imposed : between <year> and <year> apel was able to oversee a modest trend whereby the proportion of east germany 's foreign trade with west rose from <integer> % to <integer> % of the total . but more than half of the country 's trade was reported in <year> to be with the soviet union , conducted on terms favourable to moscow and disadvantageous to east germany , applying set prices that were well below `` world market prices '' , both for exports and for imports.in <year> otto grotewohl and willi stoph took over as chairman of the council of ministers . at the time there were some who saw stoph as walter ulbricht 's heir apparent . a level of rivalry within the party central committee was normal , but between apel and stoph there quickly emerged a particularly intense mutual antagonism . to the extent that both men were responsible for delivering a better future for the people there was an inherent overlap between their public profiles . stoph never missed a chance to highlight a failure to meet planned objectives or to criticise apel 's actions and utterances . pressure also increased from moscow where nikita khrushchev fell from power <days> october <year> . leonid brezhnev , the new party secretary in moscow , condemned his predecessor 's `` failures of economic leadership '' . there were a number of rapid practical changes . soviet wheat deliveries to east germany planned for <year> were cut back to 400,000 tonnes , a third of the annual quantity in existing plans . within the east german leadership apel had always been able to count on backing for his reforms from walter ulbricht , but the changes in moscow meant that ulbricht 's driving priority had was now to secure his own position . back <days> january <year> ulbricht had stunned colleagues , under the influence of apel , announcing a <other> reversal on economic policy . `` we need economics to trump politics '' ( `` wir brauchen ein primat der ökonomie über die politik ! '' ) . there was talk of revitalising the market and allowing private trade - subject to a restrictive framework - and of moving society away from a semi-military footing towards a civil one . that had been in <year> , before the fall of khrushchev . but now the leader was ready for another <integer> degree reversal over economic policy.on <integer> december <year> erich apel was due to sign a new economic agreement with the soviet union covering the period <other> . earlier that year he had traveled to moscow with walter ulbricht to finalise the terms . apel was not in favour of signing the agreement that the comrades in moscow had imposed , but he had been opposed by alfred neumann , chairman of the people 's economic council and a moscow loyalist . more importantly , he had been over-ruled by walter ulbricht . early that morning the telephone rang in apel 's office at the ministry in east berlin . willi stoph wanted a word . there was no reply . erich apel , while seated at his desk , had taken his own life . a 7.65 mm bullet from his service pistol lay at his feet . the east german signature on the trade deal with the soviets would be that of alfred neumann . news of apel 's death was held back till after the soviet signatory , trade minister nikolai patolichev had left town , later that day.there were those who believed erich apel had been murdered , in the context of an increasingly intense power struggle between politburo members as walter ulbricht 's period in power was seen to be coming to an end . ulbricht himself ordered the ministry for state security to investigate apel 's death , though later commentators found the aspects of the investigation `` uncharacteristically sloppy '' . on the other hand , west berlin 's mayor , willy brandt was never in doubt that erich apel 's death had been a suicide , performed in protest over the soviet union 's continuing exploitation of east germany . brandt reacted with a cryptic prophesy : `` he did not die quietly . we will all hear from him again , from what it was that made him do it .

instead , he took classes from henry schultz and frank knight , and wrote some of his own articles . at chicago , he became friends with another graduate student , albert gailord hart . : 372–373 boulding studied with schumpeter , : <integer> until boulding fell ill with a spontaneous pneumothorax . after recovery he spent the last six months of his commonwealth fellowship in chicago , writing articles on capital theory . : <integer> two of those articles , `` the application of the pure theory of population change to the theory of capital '' , and `` the theory of a single investment '' , were published in the quarterly journal of economics in 1934–1935 , and were the topic of frank h. knight 's reflection the next year . boulding went back to the uk for three years . he later returned to the us for good , where he was granted citizenship in <year> . === university of edinburgh === under the terms of his commonwealth fellowship boulding returned to the uk in the summer of <year> , and obtained a three-year position in economics at the university of edinburgh . academic life at the university seemed very dead to him , and he made himself unpopular with a speech to students that was published in the scotsman with the headline , `` scottish university sitting on haunches for the last fifty years . '' in those days boulding was actively involved in the quaker community , writing a pamphlet on nonviolent methods in <year> and drafting a letter for the friends to the prime minister , asking britain to disclaim the `` war guilt '' clauses in the treaty of versailles and move toward a more just peace.during this period boulding learned about paton 's accounting theory and the principles of accounting . this theory made him view the firm as `` governed by a principle that might be called the homeostasis of the constant changing balance sheet '' . boulding ( <year> ) explained that : `` in the short run , the firm simply responded to changes in the balance sheet resulting from purchases . when customers purchased finished goods , inventory went down , cash went up , and the cash would be spent on labour and materials to make more finished goods . this equilibrium balance sheet , however , would be constantly changing as technologies , new goods , and new enterprises came into play . `` : 373–374 in <year> , in his second year in edinburgh , frank h. knight published an article on his work , entitled `` the theory of investment once more : mr. boulding and the austrians , '' in the quarterly journal of economics . this brought boulding at the age of <integer> to prominence as a notable intellectual in the social sciences . === us academic life === in the summer of <year> boulding returned to the us to attend a world congress of quakers in philadelphia . he obtained a faculty position in upstate new york at colgate university . : <integer> from <year> to <year> he taught economics there . fontaine ( <year> ) summarized his stay : ... boulding enjoyed the congenial surroundings of colgate university . he did not feel alienated from his colleagues and acquaintances , as he had in british academic circles . for the first two years , social and professional life was fulfilling . but from september <year> , the invasion of poland and his home country 's declaration of war on germany caused increasing emotional distress and strong feelings of hate against the germans . his quaker convictions were shaken until he had a mystical experience <days> may <year> which restored his faith in pacifism ... : <integer> in a state of spiritual crisis boulding managed to finish his textbook , economic analysis , which he had started in the free summer semesters at colgate in the previous two years . this work would become a bestseller : <integer> and earned him even more respect in the field of economics . : <integer> from <year> to <year> , boulding taught at fisk university , a historically black school in nashville , tennessee . from <year> to <year> he was a faculty member of iowa state college , now iowa state university , and from <year> to <year> he was a faculty member of the university of michigan . in <year> he joined the faculty of the university of colorado at boulder , where he remained until his retirement . a number of national and regional scholarly societies elected boulding as their president , including the american economic association in <other> , the society for general systems research , the american association for the advancement of science ( aaas ) in <year> , the international studies association , the peace research society , and the association for the study of the grants economy . : <integer> in <year> larry d. singell stated : the election of kenneth boulding as president-elect of the aaas continues the tradition of selecting an individual who is not only distinguished because of significant and fundamental contributions to a particular field of science but who also has the knowledge and vision to look at science as a whole and accordingly to represent the entire scientific community . boulding was nominated for the nobel prize at different times for both peace and economics . === religious society of friends === boulding , with his wife elise , was an active member of the religious society of friends , or quakers . he took part in quaker gatherings , served on committees , and spoke to and about the friends . the two were members of meetings in nashville , ann arbor , and boulder . although he usually stuttered , when he ministered at a friends meeting , he spoke fluently . kenneth boulding was instrumental in organizing the first vietnam war teach-in at the university of michigan in march <days> <year> . he later spoke on the steps of the hatcher graduate library at the university and was pelted with snowballs by a group of disagreeing students . <days> march <year> , he conducted a silent vigil at the headquarters of the american friends service committee in philadelphia to protest what he considered its distancing itself from quakers . he penned the widely circulated `` there is a spirit '' , a series of sonnets he wrote in <year> based on the last statement of the 17th century quaker james nayler . == work == boulding was widely recognized in academia as a prolific writer and an integrator of knowledge . for boulding , economics and sociology were not social sciences— rather , they were all aspects of a single social science devoted to the study of human persons and their relationships ( organizations ) . boulding spearheaded an evolutionary ( instead of equilibrium ) approach to economics . boulding emphasized that human economic and other behavior is embedded in a larger interconnected system . to understand the results of our behavior , economic or otherwise , we must first research and develop a scientific understanding of the ecodynamics of the general system , the global society in which we live , in all its dimensions spiritual and material . boulding believed that in the absence of a committed effort to the right kind of social science research and understanding , the human species might well be doomed to extinction . but he was optimistic , believing our evolutionary journey had just begun . === economic analysis , <year> === boulding 's first major work in economics was his introductory textbook , entitled economic analysis . it was written when he was an instructor at colgate university in the <other> and first appeared in <year> from harper & brothers in single-volume and two-volume editions . the book was augmented and republished in four editions , the last in <year> . in a <year> book review , max millikan pointed out that the book was published at the right time and the right place . according to millikan : for some years there has been a yawning gap in the literature of economic theory between the very elementary text designed for beginning students and the clutter of specialized monographs and periodical articles accessible only to the fully trained economist . the teacher attempting to lead his charges over this difficult and dangerous terrain has had to choose between two unsatisfactory alternatives . he could devote all his time to formal lecturing about a subject that requires informal discussion and problems for its proper comprehension ; or he could assign and discuss a hodgepodge of advanced books and articles in the hope , usually vain , that some fraction of the class would struggle through to a comprehension of some fraction of the material . millikan concluded that boulding 's work had filled the gap `` neatly and effectively ... material is organized by tools of analysis and the problems in the solution of which those tools are useful rather than in the conventional manner '' . in the preface boulding had explained that the book was `` intended as a text from which the student can learn and the teacher can teach the methods and results of economic analysis . it also seeks to be a contribution to the development and systematization of the body of economic analysis itself . `` looking back in <year> , boulding explained , that `` the first edition fundamentally followed irving fisher and keynes 's treatise on money . even though i had read keynes 's general theory by that time , i think i had not really understood it . i am not quite sure that i do now . the second edition , however , in <year> , was a thoroughly keynesian general theory . `` : <integer> the first edition was published at the outbreak of world war ii and did not sell well , but the second revised edition did and became `` one of the core textbooks used in college in the united states ( and eventually around the world ) . `` : <integer> === evolutionary economics === boulding was an exponent of the evolutionary economics movement . in his `` economic development as an evolutionary system '' ( <year> , <year> ) , boulding suggests a parallel between economic development and biological evolution . === the economics of the coming spaceship earth , <year> === following the publication of rachel carson 's silent spring in <year> , the developing environmental movement drew attention to the relationship between economic growth and development and environmental degradation . boulding in his influential <year> essay `` the economics of the coming spaceship earth '' identified the need for the economic system to fit itself to the ecological system with its limited pools of resources . == publications == boulding published some thirty books and more than eight hundred articles . === books === 1940s

<days> , <year> ) was a professor of mechanical engineering at university of california , berkeley . == early life and education == paul naghdi was born in tehran on march <days> , <year> . in <year> , in order to pursue his education , he undertook a perilous voyage to the united states , during which he helped navigate the ship . he studied mechanical engineering at cornell university and graduated in <year> . after a short period in the u.s. army , he enrolled in the graduate program in the engineering mechanics department of the university of michigan . he was granted u.s. citizenship in <year> . also in <year> , he received an m.s . degree . he earned a doctorate in <year> . == career == during the period <year> to <year> , he held the position of instructor in engineering mechanics , and upon receipt of the ph.d. , he was appointed assistant professor at ann arbor . he was promoted rapidly—to associate professor in <year> and to full professor the following year . he moved to uc berkeley in <year> as professor of engineering science , and played an important role in the establishment of the division of applied mechanics in the department of mechanical engineering here . from <year> to <year> , he served as chairman of the division . from <year> onwards , he held the roscoe and elizabeth hughes chair in mechanical engineering , and in <year> he was advanced to the newly instituted position of professor in the graduate school . he was an active member of many committees of the american society of mechanical engineers ( asme ) . during the period <other> , he served on the executive committee of the applied mechanics division of the asme , and was chairman of the committee in <year> . for its fiftieth anniversary in <year> , naghdi undertook the preparation of a history of the division . from <year> to <year> , he served on the u.s. national committee on theoretical and applied mechanics , and was chairman of the committee in <other> . during the period <other> , he was a member of the general assembly of the international union of theoretical and applied mechanics . his last appointment was to the asme committee on honors ( 1986–1994 ) , of which he was chairman from <year> to <year> . == contribution to continuum mechanics == naghdi 's work on continuum mechanics extended over a period of more than forty years and encompassed almost all aspects of the mechanical behavior of solids and fluids . a consummate theoretician , he was most strongly attracted by fundamental questions in mechanics , and always sought to treat these at the highest level of generality . his work is marked by a penetrating physical intuition combined with a methodical and mathematical line of thought . he is best known for his research in the areas of shell theory and plasticity , but is also recognized for his contributions to linear and nonlinear elasticity , viscoelasticity , the theory of deformable rods , the theories of fluid sheets and jets , thermomechanics , mixture theory , and general continuum mechanics . naghdi 's interest in elastic shells and plates dated back to his graduate student days at the university of michigan , where he attended summer lectures in <year> on elastic plates by stephen timoshenko . working along classical lines , naghdi subsequently developed a systematic treatment of elastic shells and plates undergoing small deformations , which was published in <year> . during the 1950s , the modern renaissance in continuum mechanics was gathering momentum . it had started out in the 1940s as an interest in nonlinear elastic materials and non-newtonian fluids , but quickly spread to envelop a much broader range of material behavior . naghdi embraced the emerging theoretical developments and began to consider in a new light the mechanics that he had learned from classical authors such as love , lame , and whittaker . as regards shell theory , he soon realized that a completely new viewpoint could be taken which would lead to an essential clarification of the subject . this is the theory of the cosserat surface ( named after the early twentieth century french elasticians eugene and francois cosserat ) . basically , the cosserat surface is a mathematical model that idealizes a shell-like structure as a curved surface upon which additional independent vector fields are defined . naghdi was able to show that inertia , momentum , and angular momentum could be ascribed to the additional fields in such a way that a set of general dynamical equations for the deformations of shells could be obtained . he was invited to write the article on shells and plates in the handbuch der physik . this appeared in <year> ( in vol . <other> of the handbuch ) and is universally recognized as the definitive treatment of the subject . the cosserat surface is not limited to modeling only solid bodies . as naghdi came to realize in the late 1970s , sheets of water admit the same kinematical treatment as solid shells , but differ in respect to constitutive properties . naghdi and his co-authors developed an elegant theory of fluid surfaces and applied it successfully to a wide variety of problems , including waves on a stream of variable depth , flow past obstacles and boats in lakes . in <year> , r. cengiz ertekin , a phd student of john v. wehausen and paul naghdi , named these equations the green-naghdi equations . the second major focal area that attracted naghdi from the beginning of his career until the end is the behavior of elastic-plastic materials . by the <other> , a reasonably satisfactory theory of plasticity had been developed for materials undergoing small deformations . naghdi and his co-workers performed a number of experimental studies and also contributed several analytical papers on infinitesimal plasticity . naghdi 's review paper of <year> set forth a comprehensive treatment of the theory of infinitesimal plasticity and is still widely cited . in the early 1960s , naghdi set himself the task of extending plasticity theory to encompass elastic-plastic materials at finite deformations . this was a formidable challenge , since almost every aspect of the infinitesimal theory had to be changed in order to accommodate large deformations . his <year> plasticity paper with his friend and long-term collaborator a.e . green is the first systematic treatment of elastic-plastic materials undergoing large deformations . over the next two decades , naghdi continued to work on important aspects of plasticity , and in <year> , thirty years after the publication of his review article on infinitesimal plasticity , he offered an even finer critical account of the modern theory . == death == after his long career for over three decades as a professor in the department of mechanical engineering , he succumbed to lung cancer at his home in berkeley , california . he died on july <days> , <year> . == achievements == in recognition of his achievements , naghdi received many prestigious awards . in <year> , he received the university of michigan distinguished faculty award . this was followed in <year> by a john simon guggenheim memorial foundation fellowship . in <year> , he received the george westinghouse award of the american society of engineering education . on two occasions ( <year> and <year> ) , he was appointed a research professor in berkeley 's miller institute for basic research in science , and from <year> he held the roscoe and elizabeth hughes chair in mechanical engineering . for his fundamental contributions to plasticity and to shell theory , he was awarded the timoshenko medal by the asme in <year> , which justly placed his name on the list of the top engineering scientists of this century . he was made an honorary member of the asme in <year> , and a member of the national academy of engineering in <year> . in <year> , he was awarded the eringen medal of the society of engineering science in <year> . he held honorary doctor 's degrees from the national university of ireland ( <year> ) and universite catholique de louvain ( <year> ) . in <year> , he was honored with the berkeley citation . additionally , he was selected by the academic senate as one of berkeley 's two faculty research lecturers for <other> . == awards and distinctions == george westinghouse award of the

'' after discussions with the members of the politburo and after the eighth congress of the party 's central committee , the mprp officially stepped down from power on <integer> march <year> . batmönkh 's widow later recounted : `` it was march <days> <year> . batmönkh was sitting at home , preparing for his speech to the mprp 's 8th congress . the telephone rang , and after speaking a while he suddenly said `` we few mongolians should never make each other 's noses bleed '' and threw the phone away . it was not typical of him , he was a very calm person . he then said `` some leaders have come together and asked me to sign something . i 'll go there and come back '' . he kept asking for his tie , not seeing that it was right next to him . to think about it now , he was very flustered and nervous . he went out without eating , just drinking a cup of tea at the door . i stayed at home , nervous that the protestors had clashed outside . in reality , they ( others in politburo and in authority ) had asked him to sign a draft of a decree to crack down and scatter the protest outside . people who were present there later recalled that batmönkh said `` i will never sign this . we few mongols have not yet come to the point that we will make each other 's noses bleed , '' smacked the table , and left the room . `` `` he had resigned by the time he came home that

kemeny chaired the presidential commission that investigated the three mile island accident in <year> . according to györgy marx he was one of the martians . == early life == born in budapest , hungary , into a jewish family , kemeny attended the rácz private primary school in budapest and was a classmate of nándor balázs . in <year> his father left for the united states alone . in <year> , he took the whole kemeny family to the united states when the adoption of the second anti-jewish law in hungary became imminent . his grandfather , however , refused to leave and was murdered in the holocaust , along with an aunt and uncle . kemeny 's family settled in new york city where he attended george washington high school . he graduated with the best results in his class three years later . in <year> , kemeny entered princeton university where he studied mathematics and philosophy , but he took a year off during his studies to work on the manhattan project at los alamos national laboratory , where his boss was richard feynman . he also worked there with john von neumann . returning to princeton , kemeny graduated with an a.b . in mathematics in <year> after completing a senior thesis , titled `` equivalent logical systems '' , under the supervision of alonzo church . he then remained at princeton to pursue graduate studies and received a ph.d. in mathematics in <year> after completing a doctoral dissertation , titled `` type-theory vs. set-theory '' , also under the supervision of alonzo church . he worked as albert einstein 's mathematical assistant during graduate school . == career == kemeny was appointed to the dartmouth mathematics department as a full professor in <year> , at the age of <integer> . two years later he became chairman of the department , and held this post until <year> . kemeny ventured into curriculum development when he introduced finite mathematics courses . he teamed with gerald l. thompson and j. laurie snell to write introduction to finite mathematics ( <year> ) for students of biology and social sciences . the dartmouth mathematics department professors also wrote finite mathematical structures ( <year> ) and finite mathematics with business applications ( <year> ) . other colleges and universities followed this lead and several more textbooks in finite mathematics were composed elsewhere . the topic of markov chains was particularly popular so kemeny teamed with j. laurie snell to publish finite markov chains ( <year> ) to provide an introductory college textbook . considering the advances using potential theory obtained by g. a . hunt , they wrote denumerable markov chains in <year> . this textbook , suitable for advanced seminars , was followed by a second edition in <year> when an additional chapter on random fields by david griffeath was included . kemeny and kurtz were pioneers in the use of computers for ordinary people . after early experiments with algol <integer> and dope on the <other> , they invented the basic programming language in <year> , as well as one of the world 's first time-sharing systems , the dartmouth time-sharing system ( dtss ) . in <year> , the

'' this has been viewed as an application of the parsimony principle to the interpretation of characters , an important component of phylogenetic inference.he is also remembered for hennig 's progression rule in cladistics , which argues controversially that the most primitive species are found in the earliest , central part of a group 's area . == biography == === early years and studies === hennig was born in dürrhennersdorf , upper lusatia . his mother marie emma , née groß , worked as a maid and , later , factory worker . his father karl ernst emil hennig was a rail worker . willi had two brothers , fritz rudolf hennig , who became a minister , and karl herbert , who went missing at the battle of stalingrad in <year> . in the spring of <year> , willi hennig started school in dürrhennersdorf , and subsequently was at school in taubenheim an der spree and oppach . rudolf hennig described the family as calm ; his father possessed an even temperament . as of <year> , willi hennig continued his education at the realgymnasium and boarding school in klotzsche near dresden . here he met his first mentor m. rost , a science teacher , whom he lived with in a house known as the `` abteilung '' . rost had an interest in insects and introduced hennig to wilhelm meise , who worked as a scientist at the dresdener museum für tierkunde ( state museum of zoology , dresden ) . in <year> , hennig skipped a year , and graduated on <integer> february <year> . as early as <year> , willi hennig composed an essay entitled die stellung der systematik in der zoologie ( `` the state of systematics in zoology '' ) as part of his school work , published posthumously in <year> . it showed his interest as well as his deliberate treatment of systematic problems . besides school , hennig worked as a volunteer at the museum and , in collaboration with meise , saw to the systematic and biogeographical investigation of the `` flying '' snakes of the genus dendrophis that became his first published work . from the summer semester of <year> onwards , hennig read zoology , botany and geology at the university of leipzig . he would continue to visit the museum in dresden . there , he met the curator of the entomological collection , the dipteran expert fritz isidor van emden . hennig saw him regularly until van emden was expelled from national socialist germany for having a jewish mother and wife.hennig developed a deep friendship with emden 's successor , klaus günther . hennig concluded his studies with a dissertation entitled , beiträge zur kenntnis des kopulationsapparates der cyclorrhaphen dipteren . by this time , hennig had published eight scientific papers . besides his <other> revision of the tylidae ( now classed as micropezidae ) , there were further papers on diptera and the agamid genus draco of gliding lizards . after his studies , hennig was volontär at the state museum for zoology in dresden . on <integer> january <year> he obtained a scholarship from the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( dfg ) to work at the german entomological institute of the kaiser-wilhelm-gesellschaft in berlin-dahlem . on <integer> may <year> hennig married his former fellow student irma wehnert . by <year> , they had three sons , wolfgang ( born <year> ) , bernd ( born <year> ) and gerd ( born <year> ) . === as a military entomologist === willi hennig was drafted in <year> to train for the infantry and concluded this course in <year> . as of the start of world war ii , he was deployed in the infantry in poland , france , denmark and russia . he was injured by grenade shrapnel in <year> and was subsequently used as entomologist at the institute for tropical medicine and hygiene in berlin , carrying the rank of a sonderführer ( z ) . just before the war ended , he was sent to italy to the 10th army , heeresgruppe c , to fight malaria and other epidemic diseases . at the end of the war <days> may <year> , he was captured by the british while he was with the malaria training corps at the gulf of trieste , and was only released in the autumn . through his active participation in war as soldier and scientist hennig was later subjected to accusations that he had been a member of the national socialist party , especially by the italian biologist and founder of panbiogeography , leon croizat . no evidence has been officially presented to support the claim . there is no report of hennig supporting the national socialist party views publicly on any occasion . hennig did believe that nazi germany would win world war ii.during his time as prisoner of war , hennig began to draft his most important contribution to systematics , not published until <year> . the rough draft was composed with pencil and ballpoint pen into an a4 exercise book , spanning <integer> pages . during the war , he also published a further <integer> scientific papers . most of the correspondence and literature research was conducted by his wife , irma . === 1950s : basic outline of a theory of phylogenetic systematics === from <integer> december <year> to <integer> march <year> willi hennig stood in for his thesis supervisor paul buchner as assistant to professor friedrich hempelmann at the university of leipzig , giving lectures in general biology , zoology and special zoology of insects . he returned to the german entomological institute in berlin on <integer> april <year> and gave up his position in leipzig . from <integer> november <year> he led the section for systematic entomology and was second director of the institute . on <integer> august <year> he habilitated in zoology at the brandenburgische landeshochschule in potsdam . on <integer> october that year he was offered a professorship with teaching responsibilities , which he fulfilled lecturing on special zoology of invertebrates , systematic zoology and taxonomic practicals . in the same year , he published his basic outline of a theory of phylogenetic systematics , and further works on the methodology of phylogenetic systematics followed in the ensuing years , accompanied by numerous taxonomic works about diptera . his two-volume pocket book of zoology , in which he applied phylogenetic systematics to invertebrates for the first time , was particularly successful . he continued working at the german entomological institute in the soviet sector of berlin , berlin-friedrichshagen , all the while living in the american sector in berlin-steglitz . on a trip to france with his son on <integer> august <year> he heard of the impending berlin wall and returned to berlin immediately to quit his appointment . moving to east berlin was out of the question , as hennig held anti-communist views and already had a troubled relationship with the sozialistische einheitspartei deutschlands ( socialist unity party of germany , sed ) that was the ruling political party of east germany , as hennig had repeatedly helped employees of the institute gain employment in the west . === <year> to <year> === in west berlin , hennig was given an interim post at the technische universität berlin as distinguished professor . he rejected offers from the u.s. department of agriculture in washington , d.c. and an offer made by his friend elmo hardy , to become a research fellow at the university of hawaii in honolulu , citing as reasons that the education of his sons took priority for him , and that he needed to have the `` cultural witnesses of the antique greek-roman europe within ready access '' . he instead decided on a post at the state museum of natural history in stuttgart , where he was given a department for phylogenetic research . <days> april <year> , he moved to ludwigsburg-pflugfelden for this position . the scientific collections of the museum had been provisorily kept in ludwigsburg and remained here until their re-housing at the new site of the museum at stuttgart 's löwentor , in <year> . hennig 's works in stuttgart dealt almost exclusively with taxonomic revisions of dipterans . for the stuttgarter beiträge zur naturkunde , where he published the majority of his works , he completed <integer> issues by the end of his life . significant are the review articles published in erwin lindner 's flies of the palaearctic regions and the handbuch der zoologie . the cladistic methodology was also represented in several published works , foremost among them the article , cladistic analysis or cladistic classification ? a reply to ernst mayr ( <year> ) , intended as an internationally accessible reply to the criticism ernst mayr had made of hennig 's phylogenetic systematics . willi hennig only visited international institutions abroad twice , in spite of receiving many invitations for guest lectures . from <integer> september <days> <integer> november <year> he worked at the entomology research institute at canada 's department of agriculture in ottawa and participated in the international congress of entomology in canberra from <integer> to <integer> august <year> . with his wife , he also visited bangkok , new guinea ( where much of mayr 's understanding of bird taxonomy originated ) and singapore on this latter trip . his stay in canada was also used for visits to various entomological collections in museums of the us , including cambridge , chicago , washington , d.c. and new york , always in the hope of finding further amber inclusions of dipterans , that featured prominently in his research of the late 1960s and early 1970s . on the initiative of klaus günther , who by then held a chair at the freie universität berlin , hennig was given an honorary doctorate on <integer> december <year> ; for health reasons , he could not accept this honour in person , and it was presented to him by günther on <integer> march <year> in stuttgart . on the initiative of students whom he had lectured on several animal taxa , hennig was made an honorary professor at the university of tübingen on <integer> february <year> . on the night of <integer> november <year> hennig died of a heart attack at ludwigsburg . he had previously repeatedly cancelled lectures with reference to his fading health , and had already had an attack on his journey to ottawa . he was interred on <integer> november <days> the bergfriedhof in tübingen . the dipteran genus hennigiola is named after him , as is the evaniid wasp hyptia hennigi . == legacy == the willi hennig society , an organization devoted to the advancement of cladistic principles in systematic biology , was founded in <year> . the society publishes the journal cladistics . a symposium , willi hennig ( <other> ) : his life , legacy and the future of phylogenetic systematics , was held in london by the linnean society of london on

laborit ( <integer> november <year> – <integer> may <year> ) was a french surgeon , neurobiologist , writer and philosopher . in <year> , laborit was instrumental in the development of the drug chlorpromazine , published his findings , and convinced three psychiatrists to test it on a patient , resulting in great success . laborit was recognized for his work , but as a surgeon searching for an anesthetic , he became at odds with psychiatrists who made their own discoveries and competing claims . laborit wrote several books where he vulgarizes his ethological laboratory research and marries it , through systems thinking , with knowledge from several other disciplines , being a strong advocate of interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity . his writings can also be found to have deep roots in anarchist thought . he was personally untroubled by the requirements of science and the constraints of university life . he maintained an independence from academia and never sought to produce the orderly results that science requires of its adherents . == family and early years == henri laborit was born in hanoi , french indochina , in <year> . his father was a physician and colonial officer who died in <year> from tetanus . laborit contracted tuberculosis at age <integer> . in paris , he earned a baccalaureate . he spent two years in indochina on a hospital ship . he passed the examinations at the naval health service in bordeaux , and became a navy physician . he was sent to sidi abdallah bizerte . feeling that his options for recognition would be better , he switched to become a surgeon . during world war ii he was stationed on the torpedo boat sirocco , where he witnessed the evacuation of the dunkerque , and then was sunk by the germans . he was saved by an english sloop that picked him up . he received the french military cross with distinction . he was later stationed in dakar . by about <year> he was appointed to val-de-grâce hospital in paris . == chlorpromazine == laborit was the first to recognize the potential psychiatric uses of chlorpromazine . the science of anesthesiology was new since the 1930s . surgeons were sometimes responsible for anesthetics and as a french navy surgeon , laborit had seen patients die as a result of or after their operations . he became a researcher in anesthesiology . laborit 's ideas on anesthesia included potentiated anaesthesia , lowering basal metabolism and lowering body temperature ( so-called artificial hibernation ) . he advocated the use of procaine , synthetic antihistamines , diparcol ( diethazine ) , tetraethylammonium bromide and vitamin b1 . he did not like to use morphine . in his years in bizerte he became interested in the use of the antihistamine promethazine to make patients more relaxed before surgery and in contributing to anesthesia , observations that were the forerunner of his later interest in chlorpromazine . with pierre huguenard , laborit invented the lytic cocktail , a combination of drugs that could be given to patients to reduce the shock and stress they experienced during and after surgery . huguenard had success with a combination of promethazine and pethidine , at the time under the trade names diparcol and dolossal , and told laborit of his finding . laborit thought that putting patients into a state of artificial hibernation would prevent some aspects of stress reactions . these drugs made bodies stop their reactions to cooling . laborit suggested to rhône-poulenc ( a pharmaceutical company that became sanofi ) that they create antihistamines that optimized stabilization of the central nervous system . there , chemist paul charpentier headed a group trying to improve on the existing drug diphenhydramine ( benadryl , dramamine , sominex ) . so charpentier created a new series of phenothiazines , one of them by adding a chlorine atom . simone courvoisier tested the series on laboratory rats and discovered that rp <year> ( chlorinated promazine , later known as chlorpromazine ) could reverse the effects of epinephrine and could induce a state of apathy or indifference . rhône-poulenc marketed the drug in europe for vomiting , pain , nausea , and convulsions as largactil in <year> . laborit is said to have named the drug , a blended word for `` large activity '' .he , huguenard and an associate named r. alluaume published `` a new vegetative stabilizer : <year> rp . '' in la presse médicale <days> february <year> . according to max bennett , `` the effect of the drug to produce 'disinterest ' is mentioned together with the possibility that this property might make it of psychiatric use . `` immediately following its synthesis at rhône-poulenc <days> december <year> , laborit requested a sample of <year> rp to test for the purpose of reducing shock in injured soldiers . his observation that people treated with this drug showed reduced interest in their surroundings led him to suggest the first test of antipsychotics by hamon , paraire and velluz . a <other> patient with mania was released from val-de-grâce and ready `` to resume a normal life '' after <integer> days treatment with chlorpromazine and barbiturates.although it had severe side effects , chlorpromazine `` helped change the face of serious mental illness '' and allowed many patients to live outside mental asylums ; in the united states , the inpatient population of mental institutions dropped from 559,000 in <year> to 452,000 ten years later . '' == lasker award == laborit shared the prestigious lasker-debakey clinical medical research award in <year> with pierre deniker and heinz lehmann for contributions towards the general use of chlorpromazine . no one won a nobel prize for the discovery , and jean delay of the sainte-anne hospital center , who wanted to win himself , sat on the nobel committee but was opposed to giving it to laborit . laborit found himself at odds with sainte-anne hospital 's staff for the rest of his life.in <year> , the lasker foundation also recognized nathan s. kline and robert h. noce , both of whom advanced reserpine as a treatment for mental illness , as well as rustom jal vakil for treating hypertension with reserpine , and , unrelated , richard e. shope for pioneering our understanding of viruses . == career == laborit became director of the laboratoire d'eutonologie at boucicault hospital in paris . his interests included psychotropic drugs and memory . alexander zaytsev synthesized ghb in <year> , and laborit synthesized the drug in <year> . he was researching ghb as a precursor to the neurotransmitter gaba . laborit published `` sodium <other> '' in the international journal of neuropharmacology <days> september <year> . == awards and cultural references == laborit received the croix de guerre with distinction . he was elected a chevalier of the legion of honor in <year> . he received the lasker-debakey clinical medical research award which he shared in <year> , after traveling to the united states on behalf of rhône-poulenc.laborit 's ideas are the substance of the alain resnais <year> film mon oncle d'amérique in which he plays himself.laborit interviewed salvador dalí about one of his books which dalí had read but did not understand . == death and legacy == healy wrote that laborit felt cheated of his recognition and that he died a bitter man . healy noted a few attempts to set the record straight : a <year> book by jean thuillier that credits delay and deniker and laborit , a 1960s book by ann caldwell that sided with laborit , and a <year> book by judith swazey , chlorpromazine in psychiatry , which gave credit to both sides . a <year> commemoration by rhône-poulenc gave laborit credit for anesthesia but gave deniker and delay credit for application of chlorpromazine to psychiatry . in <year> , on the 200th anniversary of the founding of val-de-grâce , a plaque was placed there commemorating the discovery of chlorpromazine by laborit , harmon , paraire , and velluz in 1952.laborit was one of the pioneers of complexity theory and self-organization in france and the initiator of `` complex thought '' in his meetings with the `` groupe des dix '' . `` complex thought '' was later popularized by edgar morin . == publications == == notes == == references == == bibliography == healy , david ( <year> ) . the creation of psychopharmacology . harvard university press . isbn <days> . == external links == quotations related to henri laborit at wikiquote henri laborit at imdb horst siebert ( march <days> , <year> – june <days> , <year> ) was a german economist . he was a member of the german council of economic experts from <year> to <year> . siebert also served as a member of both the group of economic analysis ( gea ) and the group of economic policy analysis ( gepa ) , a number of `` european economists who advise the european commission ’ s president .

as part of his award , the cato institute cited his courage in espousing an approach almost universally opposed in post-world war ii international economic circles . bauer told london 's daily telegraph : `` i am truly honoured . i have long admired the cato institute and milton friedman , and recognition by both could not be more delightful . `` he died in london , england , on <integer> may <year> . == contributions to economics == nearly all of bauer 's contributions concerned development economics , international development and foreign aid . bauer sought to convince other development experts that central planning , foreign aid , price controls , and protectionism perpetuate poverty rather than eliminate it , and that the growth of government intervention politicises economic life and reduces individual freedom.bauer influenced thinking about the determinants of economic advance . for example , the world bank , in its <year> world development report , reflected the point of view bauer had been advocating for years , stating that the notion that `` good advisers and technical experts would formulate good policies , which good governments would then implement for the good of society '' was outdated : the institutional assumptions implicit in this world view were , as we all realize today , too simplistic ... . governments embarked on fanciful schemes . private investors , lacking confidence in public policies or in the steadfastness of leaders , held back . powerful rulers acted arbitrarily . corruption became endemic . development faltered , and poverty endured . for bauer , the essence of development was the expansion of individual choices , and the role of the state to protect life , liberty and property so that individuals can pursue their own goals and desires . limited government , not central planning , was his mantra . he argued that `` the exponents of western guilt ... patronize the third world by suggesting that its economic fortunes past , present , and prospective , are determined by the west ; that past exploitation by the west explains third world backwardness ... and that ( their ) economic future depends largely on western donations . `` bauer placed himself in the tradition of libertarians . in his many articles and books , including dissent on development , bauer overturned many of the commonly held beliefs of development economics . he refuted the idea that poverty is self-perpetuating and showed that central planning and large-scale public investment are not preconditions for growth . he criticised the idea that the disadvantaged could not and would not save for the future , or that they had no motivation to improve their condition . he opposed `` compulsory saving , '' which he preferred to call `` special taxation , '' and , like modern supply-side economists , stressed the detrimental effects of high taxes on economic activity . bauer also saw that government-directed investment funded by `` special taxation '' would increase `` inequality in the distribution of power . `` bauer 's experiences in malaya ( now west malaysia ) in the late 1940s and in west africa influenced his views on the importance of individual effort by small landowners and traders in moving from subsistence to a higher standard of living . bauer recognised the importance of the informal sector and advocated the `` dynamic gains '' from international trade – that is , the net gains that result from exposure to new ideas , new methods of production , new products , and new people . he demonstrated that trade barriers , and restrictive immigration and population policies deprive countries of those gains . for bauer , government-to-government aid was neither necessary nor sufficient for development , and may actually hinder it . the danger of aid , according to bauer , is that it increases the power of government , leads to corruption , misallocates resources , and erodes civil society . bauer also debunked what ralph raico has termed the `` timeless approach '' to history . a person commits this fallacy when he ignores the various events and preconditions which existed before and acted as prerequisites for the event or state of affairs being analysed . quoting raico : `` rejecting the 'timeless approach ' to economic development , bauer has accentuated the many centuries required for economic growth in the western world , and the interplay of various cultural factors that were its precondition '' == major works == bauer , p. t.

( <year> ) yuri valentinovich knorozov ( alternatively knorosov ; russian : ю́рий валенти́нович кноро́зов ; <integer> november <year> – <integer> march <year> ) was a soviet linguist , epigrapher and ethnographer , who is particularly renowned for the pivotal role his research played in the decipherment of the maya script , the writing system used by the pre-columbian maya civilization of mesoamerica . == early life == knorozov was born in the village of pivdenne near kharkiv , at that time the capital of the newly formed ukrainian socialist soviet republic . his parents were russian intellectuals , and his paternal grandmother maria sakhavyan had been a stage actress of national repute in armenia.at school , the young yuri was a difficult and somewhat eccentric student , who made indifferent progress in a number of subjects and was almost expelled for poor and willful behaviour . however , it became clear that he was academically bright with an inquisitive temperament ; he was an accomplished violinist , wrote romantic poetry and could draw with accuracy and attention to detail.in <year> at the age of <integer> , knorozov left kharkiv for moscow where he commenced undergraduate studies in the newly created department of ethnology at moscow state university 's department of history . he initially specialised in egyptology . == military service and the `` berlin affair '' == knorozov 's study plans were soon interrupted by the outbreak of world war ii hostilities along the eastern front in <other> . from <year> to <year> knorozov served his term in the second world war in the red army as an artillery spotter.at the closing stages of the war <days> may <year> , knorozov and his unit supported the push of the red army vanguard into berlin . it was here , sometime in the aftermath of the battle of berlin , that knorozov is supposed to have by chance retrieved a book which would spark his later interest in and association with deciphering the maya script . in their retelling , the details of this episode have acquired a somewhat folkloric quality , as `` ... one of the greatest legends of the history of maya research '' . the story has been much reproduced , particularly following the <year> publication of michael d. coe 's breaking the maya code.according to this version of the anecdote , when stationed in berlin , knorozov came across the national library while it was ablaze . somehow knorozov managed to retrieve from the burning library a book , which remarkably enough turned out to be a rare edition containing reproductions of the three maya codices which were then known—the dresden , madrid and paris codices . knorozov is said to have taken this book back with him to moscow at the end of the war , where its examination would form the basis for his later pioneering research into the maya script . however , in an interview conducted a year before his death , knorozov provided a different version of the anecdote . as he explained to his interlocutor , the mayanist epigrapher harri kettunen of the university of helsinki : `` unfortunately it was a misunderstanding : i told about it [ finding the books in the library in berlin ] to my colleague michael coe , but he did n't get it right . there simply was n't any fire in the library . and the books that were in the library , were in boxes to be sent somewhere else . the fascist command had packed them , and since they did n't have time to move them anywhere , they were simply taken to moscow . i did n't see any fire there . '' the `` national library '' mentioned in these accounts is not specifically identified by name , but at the time the library then known as the preußische staatsbibliothek ( prussian state library ) had that function . situated on unter den linden and today known as the berlin state library ( staatsbibliothek zu berlin ) , this was the largest scientific library of germany . during the war , most of its collection had been dispersed over some <integer> separate storage places across the country for safe-keeping . after the war much of the collection was returned to the library . however , a substantial number of volumes which had been sent for storage in the eastern part of the country were never recovered , with upwards of 350,000 volumes destroyed and a further 300,000 missing . of these , many ended up in soviet and polish library collections , and in particular at the russian state library in moscow.according to documentary sources , the so-called `` berlin affair '' is just one of many legends related to the personality of knorozov . his student ershova exposed it as merely a legend and also reported that documents belonging to knorozov , such as his military i.d . card , could prove that he did not take part in the battle of berlin and was in a different place at the time , finishing his service in a military unit located near moscow . == resumption of studies == in the autumn of <year> after world war ii , knorozov returned to moscow state university to complete his undergraduate courses at the department of ethnography . he resumed his research into egyptology , and also undertook comparative cultural studies in other fields such as sinology . he displayed a particular interest and aptitude for the study of ancient languages and writing systems , especially hieroglyphs , and he also read in medieval japanese and arabic literature.while still an undergraduate at msu , knorozov found work at the n.n . miklukho-maklai institute of ethnology and anthropology ( or iea ) , part of the prestigious academy of sciences of the ussr . knorozov 's later research findings would be published by the iea under its imprint . as part of his ethnographic curriculum knorozov spent several months as a member of a field expedition to the central asian soviet republics of the uzbek and turkmen ssrs ( what had formerly been the khorezm psr , and would much later become the independent nations of uzbekistan and turkmenistan following the <year> breakup of the soviet union ) . on this expedition his ostensible focus was to study the effects of russian expansionary activities and modern developments upon nomadic ethnic groups , of what was a far-flung frontier world of the soviet state.at this point the focus of his research had not yet been drawn on the maya script . this would change in <year> , when at the instigation of his professor , knorozov wrote his dissertation on the `` de landa alphabet '' , a record produced by the 16th century spanish bishop diego de landa in which he claimed to have transliterated the spanish alphabet into corresponding maya hieroglyphs , based on input from maya informants . de landa , who during his posting to yucatán had overseen the destruction of all the codices from the maya civilization he could find , reproduced his alphabet in a work ( relación de las cosas de yucatán ) intended to justify his actions once he had been placed on trial when recalled to spain . the original document had disappeared , and this work was unknown until <year> when an abridged copy was discovered in the archives of the spanish royal academy by the french scholar , charles étienne brasseur de bourbourg.since de landa 's `` alphabet '' seemed to be contradictory and unclear ( e.g. , multiple variations were given for some of the letters , and some of the symbols were not known in the surviving inscriptions ) , previous attempts to use this as a key for deciphering the maya writing system had not been successful . == key research == in <year> , the then <other> knorozov published a paper which was later to prove to be a seminal work in the field ( drevnyaya pis ’ mennost ’ tsentral ’ noy ameriki , or `` ancient writing of central america '' . ) the general thesis of this paper put forward the observation that early scripts such as ancient egyptian and cuneiform which were generally or formerly thought to be predominantly logographic or even purely ideographic in nature , in fact contained a significant phonetic component . that is to say , rather than the symbols representing only or mainly whole words or concepts , many symbols in fact represented the sound elements of the language in which they were written , and had alphabetic or syllabic elements as well , which if understood could further their decipherment . by this time , this was largely known and accepted for several of these , such as egyptian hieroglyphs ( the decipherment of which was famously commenced by jean-françois champollion in <year> using the tri-lingual rosetta stone artefact ) ; however the prevailing view was that mayan did not have such features . knorozov 's studies in comparative linguistics drew him to the conclusion that the mayan script should be no different from the others , and that purely logographic or ideographic scripts did not exist.knorozov 's key insight was to treat the maya glyphs represented in de landa 's alphabet not as an alphabet , but rather as a syllabary . he was perhaps not the first to propose a syllabic basis for the script , but his arguments and evidence were the most compelling to date . he maintained that when de landa had commanded of his informant to write the equivalent of the spanish letter `` b '' ( for example ) , the maya scribe actually produced the glyph which corresponded to the syllable , /be/ , as spoken by de landa . knorozov did not actually put forward many new transcriptions based on his analysis , nevertheless he maintained that this approach was the key to understanding the script . in effect , the de landa `` alphabet '' was to become almost the `` rosetta stone '' of mayan decipherment.a further critical principle put forward by knorozov was that of synharmony . according to this , mayan words or syllables which had the form consonant-vowel-consonant ( cvc ) were often to be represented by two glyphs , each representing a cv-syllable ( i.e. , cv-cv ) . in the reading , the vowel of the second was meant to be ignored , leaving the reading ( cvc ) as intended . the principle also stated that when choosing the second cv glyph , it would be one with an echo vowel that matched the vowel of the first glyph syllable . later analysis has proved this to be largely correct . == critical reactions to his work == upon the publication of this work from a then hardly known scholar , knorozov and his thesis came under some severe and at times dismissive criticism . j. eric s. thompson , the noted british scholar regarded by most as the leading mayanist of his day , led the attack . thompson 's views at that time were solidly anti-phonetic , and his own large body of detailed research had already fleshed-out a view that the maya inscriptions did not record their actual history , and that the glyphs were founded on ideographic principles . his view was the prevailing one in the field , and many other scholars followed suit.according to michael coe , “ during thompson ’ s lifetime , it was a rare maya scholar who dared to contradict ” him on the value of knorozov ’ s contributions or on most other questions . as a result , decipherment of maya scripts took much longer than their egyptian or hittite counterparts and could only take off after thompson ’ s demise in 1975.the situation was further complicated by knorozov 's paper appearing during the height of the cold war , and many were able to dismiss his paper as being founded on misguided marxist-leninist ideology and polemic . indeed , in keeping with the mandatory practices of the time , knorozov 's paper was prefaced by a foreword written by the journal 's editor which contained digressions and propagandist comments extolling the state-sponsored approach by which knorozov had succeeded where western scholarship had failed . however , despite claims to the contrary by several of knorozov 's detractors , knorozov himself never did include such polemic in his writings.knorozov persisted with his publications in spite of the criticism and rejection of many mayanists of the time . he was perhaps shielded to some extent from the ramifications of peer disputation , since his position and standing at the institute was not adversely influenced by criticism from western academics . == progress of decipherment == knorozov further improved his decipherment technique in his <year> monograph `` the writing of the maya indians '' and published translations of mayan manuscripts in his <year> work `` maya hieroglyphic manuscripts '' .during the 1960s , other mayanists and researchers began to expand upon knorozov 's ideas . their further field-work and examination of the extant inscriptions began to indicate that actual maya history was recorded in the stelae inscriptions , and not just calendric and astronomical information . the russian-born but american-resident scholar tatiana proskouriakoff was foremost in this work , eventually convincing thompson and other doubters that historical events were recorded in the script.other early supporters of the phonetic approach championed by knorozov included michael d. coe and david kelley , and whilst initially they were in a clear minority , more and more supporters came to this view as further evidence and research progressed.through the rest of the decade and into the next , proskouriakoff and others continued to develop the theme , and using knorozov 's results and other approaches began to piece together some decipherments of the script . a major breakthrough came during the first round table or mesa redonda conference at the maya site of palenque in <year> , when using the syllabic approach those present ( mostly ) deciphered what turned out to be a list of former rulers of that particular maya city-state.subsequent decades saw many further such advances , to the point now where quite a significant portion of the surviving inscriptions can be read . most mayanists and accounts of the decipherment history apportion much of the credit to the impetus and insight provided by knorozov 's contributions , to a man who had been able to make important contributions to the understanding of this distant , ancient civilisation.in retrospect , prof. coe writes that `` yuri knorozov , a man who was far removed from the western scientific establishment and who , prior to the late 1980s , never saw a mayan ruin nor touch a real mayan inscription , had nevertheless , against all odds , “ made possible the modern decipherment of maya hieroglyphic writing. ” == later life == knorozov had presented his work in <year> at the international congress of americanists in copenhagen , but in the ensuing years he was not able to travel abroad at all . after diplomatic relations between guatemala and the soviet union were restored in <year> , knorozov was invited by president vinicio cerezo to visit guatemala . president cerezo awarded knorozov the order of the quetzal and knorozov visited several of the major mayan archaeological sites , including tikal . the government of mexico awarded knorozov the order of the aztec eagle , the highest decoration awarded by the mexican state to non-citizens , in a ceremony at the mexican embassy in moscow on november <days> , 1994.knorozov had broad interests in , and contributed to , other investigative fields such as archaeology , semiotics , human migration to the americas , and the evolution of the mind . however , it is his contributions to the field of maya studies for which he is best remembered.in his very last years , knorozov is also known to have pointed to a place in the united states as the likely location of chicomoztoc , the ancestral land from which—according to ancient documents and accounts considered mythical by a sizable number of scholars—indigenous peoples now living in mexico are said to have come.knorozov died in saint petersburg on march <days> , <year> , of pneumonia in the corridors of a city hospital ( his daughter ekaterina knorozova declares that he died in a regular hospital ward at <integer> am , surrounded by the care of his family during his last days ) , just before he was due to give the tatiana proskouriakoff award lecture at harvard university . == list of publications

this was part of a wider effort to sideline his rival drăghici . between <year> and <year> , patilineț was the central committee member in charge of the securitate secret police and the romanian army . when students at the university of bucharest demonstrated on christmas eve <year> , he and mayor dumitru popa initially avoided using force , seeming to defuse the crisis but later taking measures against the ringleaders . ceaușescu believed the protest should have been forcibly dispersed from the start , and sharply criticized his subordinates for their approach . patilineț was a member of the defense council from april <year> <days> december 1972.following the late <year> arrest of general ion șerb on charges of spying for the soviet union , patilineț was removed from supervision of defense and security affairs . he then held two ministerial posts within the government : forest economy and construction materials <days> january <year> <days> december <year> ) and mines , petroleum and geology <days> december <year> <days> december <year> ) . <days> may have been named to the latter position because ceaușescu changed his mind about his handling of the christmas eve incident . his predecessor , constantin băbălău , had shown himself unable to handle the jiu valley miners ' strike of <year> , during which he was taken captive , and it is possible that ceaușescu recalled patilineț ' superior ability in managing crises . by <other> , ceaușescu , shaken by the defection of ion mihai pacepa , was keeping close surveillance on numerous high-ranking figures , patilineț included . thus , the securitate reported that he was having affairs with numerous women , which included sexual encounters in his ministerial office ; that he enjoyed fine alcoholic drinks and expensive gifts ; and that he trafficked bear pelts to germany . === conspiratorial activity and death === in the late 1970s , as ceaușescu grew increasingly despotic , patilineț was the most significant of several important figures who began considering ways to remove the leader , including through assassination . he began serving as romania 's ambassador to turkey <days> june <year> . in 1984–1985 , he reportedly held discussions with the soviet ambassador to turkey regarding the possibility of obtaining soviet aid in mounting a coup to depose ceaușescu . according to testimony offered by military officer nicolae radu in <year> , a plot for ceaușescu 's arrest existed in autumn <year> , and patilineț handled the procurement of arms for the conspirators , whose plan was foiled by an informer . it is believed that patilineț was scheduled to play a vital role in any post-ceaușescu government.in october <year> , after completing his ambassadorial mission , patilineț was driving his car from ankara to drop off his car at istanbul . as he passed on the road through kızılcıkorman village in sakarya province , he swerved suddenly and hit a truck head-on . the accident was considered suspicious ; gheorghe apostol claimed that securitate agents slipped a drug into his whisky glass prior to departure . nevertheless , no proof exists that the death constituted an assassination ordered from above . his house in the nomenklatura-populated primăverii neighborhood , where he had dwelt since <year> , passed to ion dincă.within the central committee , he was a member of the secretariat <days> july <year> <days> november <year> ) , an alternate member of the executive committee <days> august <year> <days> november <year> ) and an alternate member of the political executive committee <days> november <year> <days> november <year> ) . he was elected several successive legislatures of the great national assembly , representing maramureș county from <year> to <year> , sibiu county from <year> to <year> and bistrița-năsăud county from <year> to <year> . within that body , he headed the defense committee from march <year> to <year> . he received the order of the star of the romanian people 's republic , third class , in <year> ; and the tudor vladimirescu order , second class , in 1966.his daughter amalia , nicknamed maia , died in the 1970s as the result of an abortion . according to vladimir tismăneanu , this took place at bucharest 's elias hospital , where relatives of the party elite could obtain the procedure in spite of its being banned . however , the son of paul niculescu-mizil , serghei , has stated that the devotion of maia 's father to ceaușescu prevented her from accessing elias , and that her death resulted from a clandestine abortion . when the ban was imposed in <year> and alexandru bârlădeanu voiced his opposition , patilineț had promptly accused him of having a mistress . years later , bârlădeanu described maia 's death as divine punishment for patilineț ' slavish devotion to ceaușescu , including on the abortion issue . this sentiment reportedly began turning to hatred following the loss of his daughter . according to pacepa , the event also played a role in his demotion to the minor position of forestry minister . patilineț was in cairo at the time of the abortion , and nicolae and elena ceaușescu , enraged that a close aide would break a cherished law of theirs , ordered pacepa to send a special airplane to bring him home . they immediately summoned and verbally abused him , with elena being especially harsh . the grief-stricken patilineț responded furiously , and was demoted after the funeral . == notes == == references == adam burakowski ( tr . vasile moga ) , dictatura lui ceaușescu ( <other> ) , editura polirom , bucharest , <year> . isbn <days> florica dobre ( ed . ) , membrii c. c. al p. c. r. : <other> , cnsas . editura enciclopedicã , bucharest , <year> . isbn <days> nestor ratesh , romania : the entangled revolution , praeger publishing , <year> . isbn <days> peter siani-davies , the romanian revolution <days> december <year> , cornell university press , ithaca , <year> . isbn <days> vladimir tismăneanu , fantoma lui gheorghiu-dej , editura univers , bucharest , <year> . isbn <days> lumea secretă a nomenclaturii , editura humanitas , bucharest , <year> . isbn <days> stalinism for all seasons : a political history of romanian communism , university of california press , berkeley , <year> . isbn <days> `` understanding national stalinism : legacies of ceaușescu 's socialism '' , in henry f. carey ( ed . ) , romania since <year> : politics , economics , and society , lexington books , oxford , <year> . isbn <days> ian cecil robert rowley ( <year> – <integer> may <year> ) was an australian ornithologist of scottish origin . he was born in edinburgh and educated at wellington college and cambridge university . following service in the royal navy during the second world war , he moved to australia in <year> and graduated in agricultural science from the university of melbourne under the commonwealth reconstruction training scheme . from <year> , rowley worked for many years with the csiro on animal ecology . he was well known for his extensive studies on fairy-wrens and co-authored the book fairy-wrens and grasswrens with eleanor russell in <year> . he served the royal australasian ornithologists union as editor of emu ( 1990–2000 ) . he was elected a fellow of the raou in <year> . in <year> , he was awarded the inaugural d.l . serventy medal , which recognises excellence in published work on birds . == bibliography == rowley , ian .

sciences for his work on the theory of the optimum allocation of resources . koopmans showed that on the basis of certain efficiency criteria , it is possible to make important deductions concerning optimum price systems . == biography == koopmans was born in 's-graveland , netherlands . he began his university education at the utrecht university at seventeen , specializing in mathematics . three years later , in <year> , he switched to theoretical physics . in <year> , he met jan tinbergen , the winner of the <year> nobel memorial prize in economics , and moved to amsterdam to study mathematical economics under him . in addition to mathematical economics , koopmans extended his explorations to econometrics and statistics . in <year> he graduated from leiden university with a phd , under the direction of hendrik kramers . the title of the thesis was `` linear regression analysis of economic time series '' .koopmans moved to the united states in <year> . there he worked for a

opposition to the cowles commission by the department of economics at university of chicago during the 1950s led koopmans to convince the cowles family to move it to yale university in <year> ( where it was renamed the cowles foundation ) . he continued to publish , on the economics of optimal growth and activity analysis . koopmans 's early works on the hartree–fock theory are associated with the koopmans ' theorem , which is very well known in quantum chemistry . koopmans was awarded his nobel memorial prize ( jointly with leonid kantorovich ) for his contributions to the field of resource allocation , specifically the theory of optimal use of resources . the work for which the prize was awarded focused on activity analysis , the study of interactions between the inputs and outputs of production , and their relationship to economic efficiency and prices . finally , the importance of the article by koopmans ( <year> ) deriving the distribution of the serial correlation coefficient

what became the <year> constitution , though the manner in which the charter was ratified and modified led him to later question its legitimacy . he died of heart failure , pneumonia , and renal complications , in <year> , at the age of <integer> . macapagal was also a reputed poet in the chinese and spanish language , though his poetic oeuvre was eclipsed by his political biography . == early life == diosdado macapagal was born on september <days> , <year> , in lubao , pampanga , the third of five children in a poor family . his father was urbano macapagal y romero ( c. <year> – <year> ) , a poet who wrote in the local pampangan language and his mother was romana pangan macapagal , daughter of atanacio miguel pangan ( a former cabeza de barangay of gutad , floridablanca , pampanga ) and lorenza suing antiveros . urbano 's mother , escolástica romero macapagal , was a midwife and schoolteacher who taught catechism.diosdado is a distant descendant of don juan macapagal , a prince of tondo , who was a great-grandson of the last reigning lakan of the kingdom of tondo , lakan dula . he is also related to well-to-do licad family through his mother romana , who was a second cousin of maría vitug licad , grandmother of renowned pianist , cecile licad . romana 's own grandmother , genoveva miguel pangan and maría 's grandmother , celestina miguel macaspac , were sisters . their mother , maría concepción lingad miguel was the daughter of josé pingul lingad and gregoria malit bartolo.diosdado 's family earned extra income by raising pigs and accommodating boarders in their home . due to his roots in poverty , macapagal would later become affectionately known as the `` poor boy from lubao '' . diosdado was also a reputed poet in the spanish language although his poetic work was eclipsed by his political career . === early education === macapagal excelled in his studies at local public schools , graduating valedictorian from lubao elementary school , and salutatorian at pampanga high school . he finished his pre-law course at the university of the philippines , then enrolled at philippine law school in <year> , studying on a scholarship and supporting himself with a part-time job as an accountant . while in law school , he gained prominence as an orator and debater . however , he was forced to quit schooling after two years due to poor health and a lack of money.returning to pampanga , he joined boyhood friend rogelio de la rosa in producing and starring in tagalog operettas patterned after classic spanish zarzuelas . it was during this period that he married his friend 's sister , purita de la rosa in <year> . he had two children with de la rosa , cielo and arturo.macapagal raised enough money to continue his studies at the university of santo tomas . he also gained the assistance of philanthropist don honorio ventura , the secretary of the interior at the time , who financed his education . he also received financial support from his mother 's relatives notably from the macaspacs who owned large tracts of land in barrio sta . maria , lubao , pampanga . after receiving his bachelor of laws degree in <year> , he was admitted to the bar , topping the <year> bar examination with a score of 89.95 % . he later returned to his alma mater to take up graduate studies and earn a master of laws degree in <year> , a doctor of civil law degree in <year> , and a phd in economics in <year> . his dissertation had `` imperatives of economic development in the philippines '' as its title . === early career === after passing the bar examination , macapagal was invited to join an american law firm as a practicing attorney , a particular honor for a filipino at the time . he was assigned as a legal assistant to president manuel l. quezon in malacañang palace . during the japanese occupation of the philippines in world war ii , macapagal continued working in malacañan palace as an assistant to president josé p. laurel , while secretly aiding the anti-japanese resistance during the allied liberation country from the japanese.after the war , macapagal worked as an assistant attorney with one of the largest law firms in the country , ross , lawrence , selph and carrascoso . with the establishment of the independent third republic of the philippines in <year> , he rejoined government service when president manuel roxas appointed him to the department of foreign affairs as the head of its legal division . in <year> , president elpidio quirino appointed macapagal as chief negotiator in the successful transfer of the turtle islands in the sulu sea from the united kingdom to the philippines . that same year , he was assigned as second secretary to the philippine embassy in washington , d.c . in <year> , he was elevated to the position of counselor on legal affairs and treaties , at the time the fourth-highest post in the philippine foreign office . === first marriage === in <year> , he married purita de la rosa . they had two children , cielo macapagal-salgado ( who would become vice governor of pampanga ) and arturo macapagal . purita died in <year> . === second marriage === on may <days> , <year> , he married dr. evangelina macaraeg , with whom he had two children , gloria macapagal arroyo ( who would become president of the philippines ) and diosdado macapagal , jr. == house of representatives == on the urging of local political leaders of pampanga province , president quirino recalled macapagal from his position in washington to run for a seat in the house of representatives representing the 1st district of pampanga . the district 's incumbent , representative amado yuzon , was a friend of macapagal , but was opposed by the administration due to his support by communist groups . after a campaign that macapagal described as cordial and free of personal attacks , he won a landslide victory in the <year> election . he won re-election in the <year> election , and served as representative in the 2nd and 3rd congress . at the start of legislative sessions in <year> , the members of the house of representatives elected macapagal as chairman of the committee on foreign affairs , and he was given several important foreign assignments . he was a philippine delegate to the united nations general assembly multiple times , notably distinguishing himself in debates over communist aggression with andrei vishinsky and jacob malik of the soviet union . he took part in negotiations for the u.s.-r.p . mutual defense treaty , the laurel–langley agreement , and the japanese peace treaty . he also authored the foreign service act , which reorganized and strengthened the philippine foreign service.as a representative , macapagal authored and sponsored several laws of socio-economic importance , particularly aimed at benefiting the rural areas and the poor . among the pieces of legislation which macapagal promoted were the minimum wage law , rural health law , rural bank law , the law on barrio councils , the barrio industrialization law , and a law nationalizing the rice and corn industries . he was consistently selected by the congressional press club as one of the ten outstanding congressmen during his tenure . in his second term , he was named most outstanding lawmaker of the 3rd congress . == vice presidency == in the may <year> general elections , the liberal party drafted congressman macapagal to run for vice president as the running-mate of josé y. yulo , a former speaker of the house of representatives . macapagal 's nomination was particularly boosted by liberal party president eugenio pérez , who insisted that the party 's vice presidential nominee have a clean record of integrity and honesty . while yulo was defeated by carlos p. garcia of the nacionalista party , macapagal was elected vice president in an upset victory , defeating the nacionalista candidate , josé b. laurel , jr. , by over eight percentage points . a month after the election , he was chosen as the president of the liberal party.as the first ever philippine vice president to be elected from a rival party of the president , macapagal served out his four-year vice presidential term as a leader of the opposition . the ruling party refused to give him a cabinet position in the garcia administration , which was a break from tradition . he was offered a position in the cabinet only on the condition that he switch allegiance to the ruling nationalista party , but he declined the offer and instead played the role of critic to the administration 's policies and performance . this allowed him to capitalize on the increasing unpopularity of the garcia administration . assigned to performing only ceremonial duties as vice president , he spent his time making frequent trips to the countryside to acquaint himself with voters and to promote the image of the liberal party . as president , macapagal worked to suppress graft and corruption and to stimulate the philippine economy . == presidency == in the <year> presidential election , macapagal ran against garcia 's re-election bid , promising an end to corruption and appealing to the electorate as a common man from humble beginnings . he defeated the incumbent president with a <integer> % to <integer> % margin . his inauguration as the president of the philippines took place on december <days> , <year> . === cabinet === === major legislation signed === republic act no . <year> – an act creating a fisheries commission defining its powers , duties and functions , and appropriating funds therefore . republic act no . <year> – an act creating the philippine veterans ' bank , and for other purposes . republic act no . <year> – an act to ordain the agricultural land reform code and to institute land reforms in the philippines , including the abolition of tenancy and the channeling of capital into industry , provide for the necessary implementing agencies , appropriate funds therefor and for other purposes . republic act no . <year> – an act changing the date of philippine independence day from july four <days> june twelve , and declaring july four as philippine republic day , further amending for the purpose section twenty-nine of the revised administrative code . republic act no . <year> – an act amending republic act numbered six hundred two , otherwise known as the minimum wage law , by raising the minimum wage for certain workers , and for other purposes . === domestic policies === ==== economy ==== in his inaugural address , macapagal promised a socio-economic program anchored on `` a return to free and private enterprise '' , placing economic development in the hands of private entrepreneurs with minimal government interference.twenty days after the inauguration , exchange controls were lifted and the philippine peso was allowed to float on the free currency exchange market . the currency controls were initially adopted by the administration of elpidio quirino as a temporary measure , but continued to be adopted by succeeding administrations . the peso devalued from p2.64 to the u.s. dollar , and stabilized at p3.80 to the dollar , supported by a $ <integer> million stabilization fund from the international monetary fund.to achieve the national goal of economic and social progress with prosperity reaching down to the masses , there existed a choice of methods . first , there was the choice between the democratic and dictatorial systems , the latter prevailing in communist countries . on this , the choice was easy as filipinos had long been committed to the democratic method . with the democratic mechanism , however , the next choice was between free enterprise and the continuing of the controls system . macapagal stated the essence of free enterprise in layman parlance in declaring before congress on january <days> , <year> , that `` the task of economic development belongs principally to private enterprise and not to the government . before independence there was free enterprise in the philippines under presidents manuel quezon , sergio osmeña and manuel roxas . in <year> president elpidio quirino deviated from free enterprise launching as a temporary emergency measure the system of exchange and import controls . the controls system was carried on by president magsaysay and garcia.the first fundamental decision macapagal had to make was whether to continue the system of exchange controls of quirino , magsaysay and garcia or to return to the free enterprise of quezon , osmena and roxas . it had been his view since he was a congressman for eight years that the suitable economic system for filipinos was free enterprise . so on january <days> , <year> , after working for <integer> straight hours he signed a central bank decree abolishing exchange controls and returning the country to free enterprise.during the <integer> days available to make a decision on choice between controls and free enterprise , between his inauguration as president and before the opening of congress , macapagal 's main adviser was governor andres castillo of the central bank . further reform efforts by macapagal were blocked by the nacionalistas , who dominated the house of representatives and the senate at that time . nonetheless , macapagal was able to achieve steady economic progress , and annual gdp growth averaged at 5.53 % for 1962–65 . ==== socio-economic program ==== the removal of controls and the restoration of free enterprise was intended to provide only the fundamental setting in which macapagal could work out economic and social progress . a specific and periodic program for the guidance of both the private sector and the government was an essential instrument to attain the economic and social development that constituted the goal of his labors.such a program for his administration was formulated under his authority and direction by a group of able and reputable economic and business leaders the most active and effective of which was sixto roxas iii . from an examination of the planned targets and requirements of the five-year program – formally known as the five-year socio-economic integrated development program – it could be seen that it aimed at the following objectives . immediate restoration of economic stability ; alleviating the plight of the common man ; and establishing a dynamic basic for future growth.free enterprise was restored with decontrol . the five-year economic program had been prescribed . land reform abolishing tenancy had been launched . these were essential foundations for economic and social progress for the greatest number.the essential foundations having been laid , attention must then be turned to the equally difficult task of building the main edifice by implementing the economic program . although the success of macapagal 's socio-economic program in free enterprise inherently depended on the private sector , it would be helpful and necessary for the government to render active assistance in its implementation by the citizens.such role of the government in free enterprise , in the view of macapagal , required it ( <integer> ) to provide the social overhead like roads , airfields and ports that directly or proximately promote economic growth , ( <integer> ) to adopt fiscal and monetary policies salutary to investments , and most importantly ( <integer> ) to serve as an entrepreneur or promote of basic and key private industries , particularly those that require capital too large for businessmen to put up by themselves . among the enterprises he selected for active government promotion were integrated steel , fertilizer , pulp , meat canning and tourism . ==== land reform ==== like ramon magsaysay , president diosdado macapagal came from the masses . he savored calling himself the `` poor boy from lubao '' . ironically , he had little popularity among the masses . this could be attributed to an absence any charismatic appeal owing to his stiff personality . but despite this , macapagal had certain achievements . foremost of these was the agricultural land reform code of <year> ( republic act no . <year> ) which provided for the purchase of private farmlands with the intention of distributing them in small lots to the landless tenants on easy term of payment . it is a major development in history of land reform in the philippines , in comparison with the previous agrarian legislation , the law lowered the retention limit to <integer> hectares , whether owned by individuals or corporations . it removed the term `` contiguous '' and established the leasehold system . the share-tenancy or the kasama system was prohibited . it formulated a bill of rights that assured agricultural workers the right to self-organization and to a minimum wage . it also created an office that acquired and distributed farmlands and a financing institution for this purpose . the major flaw of this law was , however , that it had several exemptions , such as ort ( big capital plantations established during the spanish and american periods ) ; fishponds , saltbeds , and lands primarily planted to citrus , coconuts , cacao , coffee , durian , and other similar permanent trees ; landholdings converted to residential , commercial , industrial , or other similar non-agricultural purposes.it was viewed that the <other> retention limit was just too high for the growing population density . moreover , this law merely allowed the transfer of the landlordism from one area to another . this was because landlords were paid in bonds , which he could use to purchase agricultural lands . likewise , the farmer was free to choose to be excluded from the leasehold arrangements if he volunteered to give up the landholdings to the landlord.within two years after the law was implemented , no land was being purchased under its term and conditions caused by the peasants ' inability to purchase the land . besides , the government seemed lacking of strong political will , as shown by the congress ' allotment of only one million philippine pesos for the implementation of this code . at least php200 million was needed within a year from the enactment and implementation of the code , and php300 million in the next three years for the program to be successful . however , by <year> , the code had benefited only 4,500 peasants covering <integer> estates , at the cost of php57 million to the government . consequently , by the 1970s , the farmers ended up tilling less land , with their share in the farm also being less . they incurred more debts , depending on the landlord , creditors , and palay buyers . indeed , during the administration of macapagal , the productivity of the farmers further declined . ==== anti-corruption drive ==== one of macapagal 's major campaign pledges had been to clean out the government corruption that had proliferated under former president garcia . the administration also openly feuded with filipino businessmen fernando lopez and eugenio lopez , brothers who had controlling interests in several large businesses . the administration alluded to the brothers as `` filipino stonehills who build and maintain business empires through political power , including the corruption of politicians and other officials '' . in the <year> election , the lopezes threw their support behind macapagal 's rival , ferdinand marcos , with fernando lopez serving marcos ' running mate . ===== stonehill controversy ===== the administration 's campaign against corruption was tested by harry stonehill , an american expatriate with a $ <other> business empire in the philippines . macapagal 's secretary of justice , jose w. diokno investigated stonehill on charges of tax evasion , smuggling , misdeclaration of imports , and corruption of public officials . diokno 's investigation revealed stonehill 's ties to corruption within the government . macapagal , however , prevented diokno from prosecuting stonehill by deporting the american instead , then dismissing diokno from the cabinet . diokno questioned macapagal 's actions , saying , `` how can the government now prosecute the corrupted when it has allowed the corrupter to go ? '' diokno later served as a senator of the republic . ==== independence day ==== macapagal appealed to nationalist sentiments by shifting the commemoration of philippine independence day . on may <days> , <year> , he signed a proclamation which declared tuesday , june <days> , <year> , as a special public holiday in commemoration of the declaration of independence from spain on that date in <year> . the change became permanent in <year> with the signing of republic act no . <year> . for having issued his <year> proclamation , macapagal is generally credited with having moved the celebration date of the independence day holiday . years later , macapagal told journalist stanley karnow the real reason for the change : `` when i was in the diplomatic corps , i noticed that nobody came to our receptions on the fourth of july <days> but went to the american embassy instead . so , to compete , i decided we needed a different holiday . '' === foreign policies === ==== north borneo claim ==== on september <days> , <year> , during president diosdado macapagal 's administration , the territory of eastern north borneo ( now sabah ) , and the full sovereignty , title and dominion over the territory were ceded by heirs of the sultanate of sulu , hm sultan muhammad esmail e. kiram i , to the republic of the philippines . the cession effectively gave the philippine government the full authority to pursue their claim in international courts . the philippines broke diplomatic relations with malaysia after the federation had included sabah in <year> . it was revoked in <year> because succeeding philippine administrations have placed the claim in the back burner in the interest of pursuing cordial economic and security relations with kuala lumpur . to date , malaysia continues to consistently reject philippine calls to resolve the matter of sabah 's jurisdiction to the international court of justice . sabah sees the claim made by the philippines ' moro leader nur misuari to take sabah to international court of justice ( icj ) as a non-issue and thus dismissed the claim . ==== maphilindo ==== <days> july <year> , president diosdado macapagal convened a summit meeting in manila in which a nonpolitical confederation for malaysia , the philippines , and indonesia , maphilindo , was proposed as a realization of josé rizal 's dream of bringing together the malay peoples , seen as artificially divided by colonial frontiers.maphilindo was described as a regional association that would approach issues of common concern in the spirit of consensus . however , it was also perceived as a tactic on the parts of jakarta and manila to delay , or even prevent , the formation of the federation of malaysia . manila had its own claim to sabah ( formerly british north borneo ) , and jakarta protested the formation of malaysia as a british imperialist plot . the plan failed when sukarno adopted his plan of `` konfrontasi '' with malaysia . the konfrontasi , or confrontation basically aimed at preventing malaysia from attaining independence . the idea was inspired onto president sukarno by the partai komunis indonesia ( pki ) , or literally the indonesian communist party . the party convinced president sukarno that the formation of malaysia is a form of neo-colonization and would affect tranquility in indonesia . the subsequent development of asean almost certainly excludes any possibility of the project ever being revived . ==== vietnam war ==== before the end of his term in <year> , president diosdado macapagal persuaded congress to send troops to south vietnam . however this proposal was blocked by the opposition led by senate president ferdinand marcos who deserted macapagal 's liberal party and defected to the nacionalista party.the u.s. government 's active interest in bringing other nations into the war had been part of u.s. policy discussions as early as <year> . president lyndon johnson first publicly appealed for other countries to come to the aid of south vietnam on april <days> , 1964–in what was called the `` more flags '' program . chester cooper , former director of asian affairs for the white house , explained why the impetus came from the united states instead of from the republic of south vietnam : `` the 'more flags ' campaign ... required the application of considerable pressure for washington to elicit any meaningful commitments . one of the more exasperating aspects of the search…was the lassitude … ... of the saigon government . in part ... the south vietnam leaders were preoccupied with political jockeying . ... in addition , saigon appeared to believe that the program was a public relations campaign directed at the american people . '' === <year> midterm election === the senatorial election was held on november <days> , <year> . macapagal 's liberal party ( lp ) won four out of the eight seats up for grabs during the election – thereby increasing the lp 's senate seats from eight to ten . === <year> presidential campaign === towards the end of his term , macapagal decided to seek re-election to continue seeking reforms which he claimed were stifled by a `` dominant and uncooperative opposition '' in congress . with senate president ferdinand marcos , a fellow member of the liberal party , unable to win his party 's nomination due to macapagal 's re-election bid , marcos switched allegiance to the rival nacionalista party to oppose macapagal.among the issues raised against the incumbent administration were graft and corruption , rise in consumer goods , and persisting peace and order issues . macapagal was defeated by marcos in the november <year> polls . == post-presidency and death == macapagal announced his retirement from politics following his <year> loss to marcos . in <year> , he was elected president of the constitutional convention that drafted what became the <year> constitution . the manner in which the charter was ratified and later modified led him to later question its legitimacy . in <year> , he formed the national union for liberation as a political party to oppose the marcos regime . following the restoration of democracy in <year> , macapagal took on the role of elder statesman , and was a member of the philippine council of state . he also served as honorary chairman of the national centennial commission , and chairman of the board of cap life , among others . in his retirement , macapagal devoted much of his time to reading and writing . he published his presidential memoir , authored several books about government and economics , and wrote a weekly column for the manila bulletin newspaper . diosdado macapagal died of heart failure , pneumonia and renal complications at the makati medical center on april <days> , <year> . he is buried at the libingan ng mga bayani . == legacy == on september <days> , <year> , macapagal 's daughter , president gloria macapagal arroyo , inaugurated the president diosdado macapagal museum and library , located at his home town of lubao , pampanga.president benigno s. aquino iii declared september <days> , <year> as a special non-working holiday in macapagal 's home province of pampanga to commemorate the centennial of his birth . === museum and library === these house the personal books and memorabilia of macapagal . == electoral history == vice presidential election , <year> : diosdado macapagal ( liberal party ) – 2,189,197 ( 46.55 % ) josé laurel jr.

entrepreneur best known for founding the retailers walmart and sam 's club . wal-mart stores inc. grew to be the world 's largest corporation by revenue as well as the biggest private employer in the world . for a period of time , walton was the richest man in america . == early life == samuel moore walton was born to thomas gibson walton and nancy lee , in kingfisher , oklahoma . he lived there with his parents on their farm until <year> . however , farming did not provide enough money to raise a family , and thomas walton went into farm mortgaging . he worked for his brother 's walton mortgage company , which was an agent for metropolitan life insurance , where he foreclosed on farms during the great depression.he and his family ( now with another son , james , born in <year> ) moved from oklahoma . they moved from one small town to another for several years , mostly in missouri . while attending eighth grade in shelbina , missouri , sam became the youngest eagle scout in the state 's history . in adult life , walton became a recipient of the distinguished eagle scout award from the boy scouts of america.eventually the family moved to columbia , missouri . growing up during the great depression , he did chores to help make financial ends meet for his family as was common at the time . he milked the family cow , bottled the surplus , and drove it to customers . afterwards , he would deliver columbia daily tribune newspapers on a paper route . in addition , he sold magazine subscriptions . upon graduating from david h. hickman high school in columbia , he was voted `` most versatile boy '' . after high school , walton decided to attend college , hoping to find a better way to help support his family . he attended the university of missouri as an rotc cadet . during this time , he worked various odd jobs , including waiting tables in exchange for meals . also during his time in college , walton joined the zeta phi chapter of beta theta pi fraternity . he was also tapped by qebh , the well-known secret society on campus honoring the top senior men , and the national military honor society scabbard and blade . additionally , walton served as president of burall bible class , a large class of students from the university of missouri and stephens college . upon graduating in <year> with a bachelor 's degree in economics , he was voted `` permanent president '' of the class.furthermore , he elaborated that he learned from a very early age that it was important for them as kids to help provide for the home , to be givers rather than takers . walton realized while serving in the army , that he wanted to go into retailing and to go into business for himself.walton joined j. c. penney as a management trainee in des moines , iowa , three days after graduating from college . this position paid him $ <integer> a month . walton spent approximately <integer> months with j. c. penney . he resigned in <year> in anticipation of being inducted into the military for service in world war ii . in the meantime , he worked at a dupont munitions plant near tulsa , oklahoma . soon afterwards , walton joined the military in the u.s. army intelligence corps , supervising security at aircraft plants and prisoner of war camps . in this position he served at fort douglas in salt lake city , utah . he eventually reached the rank of captain . == the first stores == in <year> , after leaving the military , walton took over management of his first variety store at the age of <integer> . with the help of a $ 20,000 loan from his father-in-law , plus $ 5,000 he had saved from his time in the army , walton purchased a ben franklin variety store in newport , arkansas . the store was a franchise of the butler brothers chain . walton pioneered many concepts that became crucial to his success . according to walton , if he offered prices as good or better than stores in cities that were four hours away by car , people would shop at home . walton made sure the shelves were consistently stocked with a wide range of goods . his second store , the tiny `` eagle '' department store , was down the street from his first ben franklin and next door to its main competitor in newport . with the sales volume growing from $ 80,000 to $ 225,000 in three years , walton drew the attention of the landlord , p. k. holmes , whose family had a history in retail . admiring sam 's great success , and desiring to reclaim the store ( and franchise rights ) for his son , he refused to renew the lease . the lack of a renewal option , together with the prohibitively high rent of <integer> % of sales , were early business lessons to walton . despite forcing walton out , holmes bought the store 's inventory and fixtures for $ 50,000 , which walton called `` a fair price '' . with a year left on the lease , but the store effectively sold , he , his wife helen and his father-in-law managed to negotiate the purchase of a new location on the downtown square of bentonville , arkansas . walton negotiated the purchase of a small discount store , and the title to the building , on the condition that he get a <other> lease to expand into the shop next door . the owner of the shop next door refused six times , and walton gave up on bentonville when his father-in-law , without sam 's knowledge , paid the shop owner a final visit and $ 20,000 to secure the lease . he had just enough left from the sale of the first store to close the deal , and reimburse helen 's father . they opened for business with a one-day remodeling sale on may <days> , 1950.before he bought the bentonville store , it was doing $ 72,000 in sales and it increased to $ 105,000 in the first year and then $ 140,000 and $ 175,000 . == a chain of ben franklin stores == with the new bentonville `` five and dime '' opening for business , and <integer> miles away , a year left on the lease in newport , the money-strapped young walton had to learn to delegate responsibility.after succeeding with two stores at such a distance ( and with the postwar baby boom in full effect ) , sam became enthusiastic about scouting more locations and opening more ben franklin franchises . ( also , having spent countless hours behind the wheel , and with his close brother james `` bud '' walton having been a pilot in the war , he decided to buy a small second-hand airplane . both he and his son john would later become accomplished pilots and log thousands of hours scouting locations and expanding the family business . ) in <year> , he opened a store with his brother bud in a shopping center in ruskin heights , a suburb of kansas city , missouri . with the help of his brother and father-in-law , sam went on to open many new variety stores . he encouraged his managers to invest and take an equity stake in the business , often as much as $ <year> in their store , or the next outlet to open . ( this motivated the managers to sharpen their managerial skills and take ownership over their role in the enterprise . ) by <year> , along with his brother bud , he owned <integer> stores in arkansas , missouri , and kansas ( fifteen ben franklin 's and one independent , in fayetteville ) .sam walton is regarded as one of the greatest project entrepreneurs in the retail chain industry . he had a great passion for learning . he frequently made unannounced visits to walmarts around the country to learn what local innovations were working that then could be shared with other walmarts . on one of those visits he was puzzled by a greeter saying “ hello ” at the entrance of the store and asked the fellow what he was doing . the greeter explained that his main job was to discourage shoplifters from taking unpaid merchandise out of the store through the entrance . walton was delighted and shared the innovation with “ associates ” throughout his chain . == first walmart == the first true walmart opened on july <days> , <year> , in rogers , arkansas . called the wal-mart discount city store , it was located at <integer> west walnut street . he launched a determined effort to market american-made products . included in the effort was a willingness to find american manufacturers who could supply merchandise for the entire walmart chain at a price low enough to meet the foreign competition.as the meijer store chain grew , it caught the attention of walton . he came to acknowledge that his one-stop-shopping center format was based on meijer 's original innovative concept . contrary to the prevailing practice of american discount store chains , walton located stores in smaller towns , not larger cities . to be near consumers , the only option at the time was to open outlets in small towns . walton 's model offered two advantages . first , existing competition was limited and secondly , if a store was large enough to control business in a town and its surrounding areas , other merchants would be discouraged from entering the market.to make his model work , he emphasized logistics , particularly locating stores within a day 's drive of walmart 's regional warehouses , and distributed through its own trucking service . buying in volume and efficient delivery permitted sale of discounted name brand merchandise . thus , sustained growth—from <year> 's <integer> stores to <year> 's 800—was achieved.given its scale and economic influence , walmart is noted to significantly impact any region in which it establishes a store . these impacts , both positive and negative , have been dubbed the `` walmart effect '' . == personal life == walton married helen robson on valentine 's day , february <days> , <year> . they had four children : samuel robson ( rob ) born in <year> , john thomas ( 1946–2005 ) , james carr ( jim ) born in <year> , and alice louise born in 1949.walton supported various charitable causes . he and helen were active in 1st presbyterian church in bentonville ; sam served as an elder and a sunday school teacher , teaching high school age students . the family made substantial contributions to the congregation . walton worked the concept of “ service leadership ” into the corporate structure of walmart based on the concept of christ being a servant leader and emphasized the importance of serving others based in christianity . === death === walton died on sunday , april <days> , <year> ( three months shy of walmart 's thirtieth anniversary ) , of multiple myeloma , a type of blood cancer , in little rock , arkansas . the news of his death was relayed by satellite to all 1,960 walmart stores . at the time , his company employed 380,000 people . annual sales of nearly $ <integer> billion flowed from 1,735 walmarts , <integer> sam 's clubs , and <integer> supercenters.his remains are interred at the bentonville cemetery . he left his ownership in walmart to his wife and their children : rob walton succeeded his father as the chairman of walmart , and john walton was a director until his death in a <year> plane crash . the others are not directly involved in the company ( except through their voting power as shareholders ) , however his son jim walton is chairman of arvest bank . the walton family held five spots in the top ten richest people in the united states until <year> . two daughters of sam 's brother bud walton—ann kroenke and nancy laurie—hold smaller shares in the company . == legacy == in <year> , walton was included in time 's list of <integer> most influential people of the 20th century . walton was honored for his work in retail <days> march <year> , just one month before his death , when he received the presidential medal of freedom from then-president george h. w. bush.forbes ranked sam walton as the richest person in the united states from <year> to <year> , ceding the top spot to john kluge in <year> when the editors began to credit walton 's fortune jointly to him and his four children .

first person interview conducted on november <days> , <year> , with frank robson , brother-in-law of sam walton . charles gald sibley ( august <days> , <year> – april <days> , <year> ) was an american ornithologist and molecular biologist . he had an immense influence on the scientific classification of birds , and the work that sibley initiated has substantially altered our understanding of the evolutionary history of modern birds . sibley 's taxonomy has been a major influence on the sequences adopted by ornithological organizations , especially the american ornithologists ' union . charles sibley is of no known family relation to renowned bird artist and prolific author of numerous bird identification guides david sibley . == life and work == educated in california ( a.b . <year> ; ph.d. <year> in zoology , university of california , berkeley . minor fields : paleontology , botany ) , he did his first fieldwork in mexico in <year> and <year> , then in solomon islands , bismarck archipelago , new guinea , and the philippines during world war ii while on leave from the u.s. navy , in which he was ensign to lieutenant in the communications and medical service corps . he was based for much of the war at emirau island , in what is now new ireland province of papua new guinea . his first job after college was from <year> to <year> as instructor in zoology and curator of birds , university of kansas , followed from <year> to <year> as assistant professor of zoology , san jose state college , california . from <year> to <year> he was associate professor then professor of zoology and director of the ornithological laboratory at cornell . between <year> and <year> he was professor of biology and william robertson coe prof. of ornithology , dept of biology ; and curator of birds at the peabody museum at yale . from <year> to <year> he was dean 's professor of science and professor of biology at san francisco state university , and from <year> until his death he was adjunct professor of biology at sonoma state university . sibley developed an interest in hybridisation and its implications for evolution and taxonomy and , in the early 1960s he began to focus on molecular studies : of blood proteins , and then the electrophoresis of egg-white proteins . by the early 1970s sibley was pioneering dna-dna hybridisation studies , with the aim of discovering , once and for all , the true relationships between the modern orders of birds . these were highly controversial to begin with , and regarded by colleagues as anything from snake-oil salesmanship on the one hand to holy writ on the other . with the passage of time and ever-improving laboratory methods , the balance of scientific opinion has shifted closer to the latter interpretation , though the picture is by no means clear-cut and simple . some of sibley 's results – such as the close relationship of galliform birds and waterfowl and their distinctness from other neognaths – have been verified . other results such as the inclusion of diverse groups into the ciconiiformes have turned out to be very much in error . sibley became estranged from his american co-workers for a time and corresponded with overseas colleagues extensively . but by the mid to late 1980s , sibley 's ongoing work had reversed the trend . his revised phylogeny of living birds in the light of dna analysis , published in various forms in 1986–1993 was both controversial and highly influential . in <year> he was elected a member , national academy of sciences , u.s.a . in <year> sibley and jon ahlquist were awarded the daniel giraud elliot medal from the national academy of sciences . he was elected president of the international ornithological congress in <year> . his landmark publications , phylogeny and classification of birds ( written with ahlquist ) and distribution and taxonomy of birds of the world ( with burt monroe ) are among the most-cited of all ornithological works , the former setting out the influential sibley-ahlquist taxonomy . == acid tongue == during the 1970s , sibley was a highly controversial figure in ornithological circles , for both professional and personal reasons . his friend richard schodde , writing sibley 's obituary in emu , commented that he was : ... a rebel with a cause . in argument he would bulldoze through , brooking no contradiction . critics were baited with an acid tongue , and , in fits of temper , he could be a cruel mimic . in short , lesser mortals were not tolerated easily and , as has been said by others , collegiate friends were few . ... i never found him malicious or vindictive , even against those who had tried to bring him down . nor was he particularly sophisticated or cultured , just a big , up-front yank possessed by 'the big picture ' in avian phylogeny and convinced of the righteousness of his cause and invincibility of his intellect . partly due to personality conflicts , sibley had few long-term collaborations with other scientists , with the notable exception of jon ahlquist . nonetheless , he was effective in persuading others to provide him with the blood , tissue , and egg white samples which were the key to his work . == other ornithological sibleys == charles gald sibley is of no known family relation to renowned bird artist and bird guide author david sibley , although the families knew each other : one of charles ' daughters babysat david , and david 's father fred worked for charles at yale . there is some family resemblance , and charles did a fair amount of genealogical research but could only establish that any relationship was no closer than fourth cousin . == see also == sibley-ahlquist taxonomy == references == == further reading ==

: , french : [ ʒak iv kusto ] ; <integer> june <year> – <integer> june <year> ) was a french naval officer , explorer , conservationist , filmmaker , scientist , photographer , author and researcher who studied the sea and all forms of life in water . he co-developed the aqua-lung , pioneered marine conservation and was a member of the académie française . cousteau described his underwater world research in a series of books , perhaps the most successful being his first book , the silent world : a story of undersea discovery and adventure , published in <year> . cousteau also directed films , most notably the silent world , the documentary adaptation of his book , which won a palme d'or at the <year> cannes film festival . he remained the only person to win a palme d'or for a documentary film until michael moore won the award in <year> for fahrenheit <other> . == biography == === early life === cousteau was born on <integer> june <year> , in saint-andré-de-cubzac , gironde , france , to daniel and élisabeth cousteau . he had one brother , pierre-antoine . cousteau completed his preparatory studies at the collège stanislas in paris . in <year> , he entered the école navale and graduated as a gunnery officer . however , an automobile accident , which broke both his arms , cut short his career in naval aviation . the accident forced cousteau to change his plans to become a naval pilot , so he then indulged his passion for the ocean.in toulon , where he was serving on the condorcet , cousteau carried out his first underwater experiments , thanks to his friend philippe tailliez who in <year> lent him some fernez underwater goggles , predecessors of modern swimming goggles . cousteau also belonged to the information service of the french navy , and was sent on missions to shanghai and japan ( 1935–1938 ) and in the ussr ( <year> ) .on <integer> july <year> , he married simone melchior , his business partner , with whom he had two sons , jean-michel ( born <year> ) and philippe ( 1940–1979 ) . his sons took part in the adventures of the calypso . in <year> , one year after his wife simone 's death from cancer , he married francine triplet . they already had a daughter diane cousteau ( born <year> ) and a son , pierre-yves cousteau ( born <year> ) , born during cousteau 's marriage to his first wife . === early 1940s : innovation of modern underwater diving === the years of world war ii were decisive for the history of diving . after the armistice of <year> , the family of simone and jacques-yves cousteau took refuge in megève , where he became a friend of the ichac family who also lived there . jacques-yves cousteau and marcel ichac shared the same desire to reveal to the general public unknown and inaccessible places — for cousteau the underwater world and for ichac the high mountains . the two neighbors took the first ex-aequo prize of the congress of documentary film in <year> , for the first french underwater film : par dix-huit mètres de fond ( <integer> meters deep ) , made without breathing apparatus the previous year in the embiez islands in var , with philippe tailliez and frédéric dumas , using a depth-pressure-proof camera case developed by mechanical engineer léon vèche , an engineer of arts and measures at the naval college . in <year> , they made the film épaves ( shipwrecks ) , in which they used two of the very first aqua-lung prototypes . these prototypes were made in boulogne-billancourt by the air liquide company , following instructions from cousteau and émile gagnan . when making épaves , cousteau could not find the necessary blank reels of movie film , but had to buy hundreds of small still camera film reels the same width , intended for a make of child 's camera , and cemented them together to make long reels.having kept bonds with the english speakers ( he spent part of his childhood in the united states and usually spoke english ) and with french soldiers in north africa ( under admiral lemonnier ) , jacques-yves cousteau ( whose villa `` baobab '' at sanary ( var ) was opposite admiral darlan 's villa `` reine '' ) , helped the french navy to join again with the allies ; he assembled a commando operation against the italian espionage services in france , and received several military decorations for his deeds . at that time , he kept his distance from his brother pierre-antoine cousteau , a `` pen anti-semite '' who wrote the collaborationist newspaper je suis partout ( i am everywhere ) and who received the death sentence in <year> . however , this was later commuted to a life sentence , and pierre-antoine was released in <year> . during the 1940s , cousteau is credited with improving the aqua-lung design which gave birth to the open-circuit scuba technology used today . according to his first book , the silent world : a story of undersea discovery and adventure ( <year> ) , cousteau started diving with fernez goggles in <year> , and in <year> used the self-contained underwater breathing apparatus invented in <year> by commander yves le prieur . cousteau was not satisfied with the length of time he could spend underwater with the le prieur apparatus so he improved it to extend underwater duration by adding a demand regulator , invented in <year> by émile gagnan . in <year> cousteau tried out the first prototype aqua-lung which finally made extended underwater exploration possible . === late 1940s : gers and élie monnier === in <year> , cousteau and tailliez showed the film épaves ( `` shipwrecks '' ) to admiral lemonnier , who gave them the responsibility of setting up the groupement de recherches sous-marines ( grs ) ( underwater research group ) of the french navy in toulon . a little later it became the gers ( groupe d'études et de recherches sous-marines , = underwater studies and research group ) , then the comismer ( `` commandement des interventions sous la mer '' , = `` undersea interventions command '' ) , and finally more recently the cephismer . in <year> , chief petty officer maurice fargues became the first diver to die using an aqualung , while attempting a new depth record with the gers near toulon.in <year> , between missions of mine clearance , underwater exploration and technological and physiological tests , cousteau undertook a first campaign in the mediterranean on board the sloop élie monnier , with philippe tailliez , frédéric dumas , jean alinat and the scenario writer marcel ichac . the small team also undertook the exploration of the roman wreck of mahdia ( tunisia ) . it was the first underwater archaeology operation using autonomous diving , opening the way for scientific underwater archaeology . cousteau and marcel ichac brought back from there the carnets diving film ( presented and preceded with the cannes film festival <year> ) . cousteau and the élie monnier then took part in the rescue of professor jacques piccard 's bathyscaphe , the <other> , during the <year> expedition to dakar . thanks to this rescue , the french navy was able to reuse the sphere of the bathyscaphe to construct the <other> . the adventures of this period are told in the two books the silent world ( <year> , by cousteau and dumas ) and plongées sans câble ( <year> , by philippe tailliez ) . === 1950–1970s === in <year> , cousteau left the french navy . in <year> , he founded the french oceanographic campaigns ( foc ) , and leased a ship called calypso from thomas loel guinness for a symbolic one franc a year . cousteau refitted the calypso as a mobile laboratory for field research and as his principal vessel for diving and filming . he also carried out underwater archaeological excavations in the mediterranean , in particular at grand-congloué ( <year> ) . with the publication of his first book in <year> , the silent world , cousteau correctly predicted the existence of the echolocation abilities of porpoises . he reported that his research vessel , the élie monier , was heading to the straits of gibraltar and noticed a group of porpoises following them . cousteau changed course a few degrees off the optimal course to the center of the strait , and the porpoises followed for a few minutes , then diverged toward mid-channel again . it was evident that they knew where the optimal course lay , even if the humans did not . cousteau concluded that the cetaceans had something like sonar , which was a relatively new feature on submarines . in <year> , cousteau conducted a survey of abu dhabi waters on behalf of british petroleum . among those accompanying him was louis malle who made a black-and-white film of the expedition for the company . cousteau won the palme d'or at the cannes film festival in <year> for the silent world co-produced with malle . in <year> , cousteau took over as leader of the oceanographic museum of monaco . afterward , with the assistance of jean mollard , he made a `` diving saucer '' <other> , an experimental underwater vehicle which could reach a depth of <integer> meters . the successful experiment was quickly repeated in <year> with two vehicles which reached <integer> meters . in <year> , he was elected as director of the oceanographical museum of monaco . he directed précontinent , about the experiments of diving in saturation ( long-duration immersion , houses under the sea ) , and was admitted to the united states national academy of sciences . he was involved in the creation of confédération mondiale des activités subaquatiques and served as its inaugural president from <year> to 1973.cousteau also took part in inventing the `` <other> denise diving saucer '' in <year> which was an invention best for exploring the ocean floor , as it allowed one to explore on solid ground.in october <year> , a large amount of radioactive waste was going to be discarded in the mediterranean sea by the commissariat à l'énergie atomique ( cea ) . the cea argued that the dumps were experimental in nature , and that french oceanographers such as vsevelod romanovsky had recommended it . romanovsky and other french scientists , including louis fage and jacques cousteau , repudiated the claim , saying that romanovsky had in mind a much smaller amount . the cea claimed that there was little circulation ( and hence little need for concern ) at the dump site between nice and corsica , but french public opinion sided with the oceanographers rather than with the cea atomic energy scientists . the cea chief , francis perrin , decided to postpone the dump . cousteau organized a publicity campaign which in less than two weeks gained wide popular support . the train carrying the waste was stopped by women and children sitting on the railway tracks , and it was sent back to its origin . in the 1960s , cousteau was involved with a set of three projects to build underwater `` villages '' ; the projects were named precontinent i , precontinent ii and precontinent iii . each ensuing project was aimed at increasing the depth at which people continuously lived under water , and were an attempt at creating an environment in which men could live and work on the sea floor . the projects are best known as conshelf i ( <year> ) , conshelf ii ( <year> ) , and conshelf iii ( <year> ) . the names `` precontinent '' , and `` continental shelf station '' ( conshelf ) were used interchangeably by cousteau . a meeting with american television companies ( abc , métromédia , nbc ) created the series the undersea world of jacques cousteau , with the character of the commander in the red bonnet inherited from standard diving dress intended to give the films a `` personalized adventure '' style . this documentary television series ran for ten years from <year> to <year> . a second documentary series , the cousteau odyssey , ran from <year> to <year> on public television stations . in <year> , he wrote the book the shark : splendid savage of the sea with his son philippe . in this book , cousteau described the oceanic whitetip shark as `` the most dangerous of all sharks '' . <days> december <year> , two years after the volcano 's last eruption , the cousteau society was filming voyage au bout du monde on deception island , antarctica , when michel laval , calypso 's second in command , was struck and killed by a rotor of the helicopter that was ferrying between calypso and the island.in <year> , along with his two sons and frederick hyman , he created the cousteau society for the protection of ocean life , frederick hyman being its first president . in <year> , john denver released the tribute song `` calypso '' on his album windsong , and on the b-side of his hit song `` i 'm sorry '' . `` calypso '' became a hit on its own and was later considered the new a-side , reaching no . <integer> on the charts . in <year> , cousteau located the wreck of hmhs britannic . he also found the wreck of the french <other> ship-of-the-line la therese in coastal waters of crete . in <year> , together with peter scott , he received the un international environment prize . on <integer> june <year> , while the calypso was on an expedition to portugal , his second son philippe , his preferred and designated successor and with whom he had co-produced all his films since <year> , died in a pby catalina flying boat crash in the tagus river near lisbon . cousteau was deeply affected . he called his then eldest son , the architect jean-michel , to his side . this collaboration lasted <integer> years . === 1980–1990s === from <year> to <year> , he was a regular on the animal reality show those amazing animals , along with burgess meredith , priscilla presley , and jim stafford . in <year> , cousteau traveled to canada to make two films on the saint lawrence river and the great lakes , cries from the deep and st. lawrence : stairway to the sea.in <year> , he received the presidential medal of freedom from u.s. president ronald reagan . from <year> to <year> , cousteau released rediscovery of the world . on <integer> november <year> , he was elected to the académie française , chair <integer> , succeeding jean delay . his official reception under the cupola took place on <integer> june <year> , the response to his speech of reception being given by bertrand poirot-delpech . after his death , he was replaced by érik orsenna on <integer> may <year> . <days> june <year> , the composer jean michel jarre paid homage to the commander by entitling his new album waiting for cousteau . he also composed the music for cousteau 's documentary `` palawan , the last refuge '' . on <integer> december <year> , his wife , simone cousteau died of cancer . <days> june <year> , in paris , jacques-yves cousteau remarried , to francine triplet , with whom he had ( before this marriage ) two children , diane and pierre-yves . francine cousteau currently continues her husband 's work as the head of the cousteau foundation and cousteau society . from that point , the relations between jacques-yves and his elder son worsened . <days> november <year> , cousteau gave an interview to the unesco courier , in which he stated that he was in favour of human population control and population decrease . widely quoted on the internet are these two paragraphs from the interview : `` what should we do to eliminate suffering and disease ? it 's a wonderful idea but perhaps not altogether a beneficial one in the long run . if we try to implement it <days> may jeopardize the future of our species ... it 's terrible to have to say this . world population must be stabilized and to do that we must eliminate 350,000 people per day . this is so horrible to contemplate that we should n't even say it . but the general situation in which we are involved is lamentable '' .in <year> , he was invited to rio de janeiro , brazil , for the united nations ' international conference on environment and development , and then he became a regular consultant for the un and the world bank . in <year> , he sued his son , who was advertising `` cousteau fiji islands resort '' , to prevent him from using the cousteau name for business purposes in the united states.on <integer> january <year> , calypso was accidentally rammed and sunk in the port of singapore by a barge . the calypso was refloated and towed home to france . === religious views === though he was not particularly a religious man , cousteau believed that the teachings of the different major religions provide valuable ideals and thoughts to protect the environment . in a chapter entitled `` the holy scriptures and the environment '' in the posthumous work the human , the orchid , and the octopus , he is quoted as stating that `` the glory of nature provides evidence that god exists '' . === opinion on recreational fishing === cousteau said because fish are cold-blooded , does not mean they do not feel pain , and that recreational fishermen only say so to reassure their conscience . == death and legacy == jacques-yves cousteau died of a heart attack on <integer> june <year> in paris , two weeks after his 87th birthday . he was buried in the family vault at saint-andré-de-cubzac , his birthplace . an homage was paid to him by the town by naming the street which runs out to the house of his birth `` rue du commandant cousteau '' , where a commemorative plaque was placed . cousteau 's legacy includes more than <integer> television documentaries , more than <integer> books , and an environmental protection foundation with 300,000 members.cousteau liked to call himself an `` oceanographic technician '' . he was , in reality , a sophisticated showman , teacher , and lover of nature . his work permitted many people to explore the resources of the oceans . his work also created a new kind of scientific communication , criticized at the time by some academics . the so-called `` divulgationism '' , a simple way of sharing scientific concepts , was soon employed in other disciplines and became one of the most important characteristics of modern television broadcasting . ironically , cousteau 's most lasting legacy may <days> a negative one . his oceanographic museum in monaco , and perhaps even he himself , has been identified as introducing the caulerpa `` killer algae , '' which is destroying much of the mediterranean 's ecosystem . the cousteau society and its french counterpart , l'équipe cousteau , both of which jacques-yves cousteau founded , are still active today . the society is currently attempting to turn the original calypso into a museum and it is raising funds to build a successor vessel , the calypso ii . in his last years , after marrying again , cousteau became involved in a legal battle with his son jean-michel over jean-michel licensing the cousteau name for a south pacific resort , resulting in jean-michel cousteau being ordered by the court not to encourage confusion between his for-profit business and his father 's non-profit endeavours . in <year> , the international watch company introduced the iwc aquatimer chronograph `` cousteau divers '' special edition . the timepiece incorporated a sliver of wood from the interior of cousteau 's calypso research vessel . having developed the diver 's watch , iwc offered support to the cousteau society . the proceeds from the timepieces ' sales were partially donated to the non-profit organization involved in conservation of marine life and preservation of tropical coral reefs.the <year> science-fiction book the deep range mentions a large research expedition submarine named cousteau . one episode of elinor wonders why features him in a musical sequence where he is depicted as an otter . == awards and honors == during his lifetime , jacques-yves cousteau received these distinctions : cross of war 1939–1945 ( <year> ) national geographic society 's special gold medal in <year> commander of the legion of honour (

<integer> april <year> – <integer> august <year> ) was a french centre-right politician and economist . he was a vice president of the european commission and commissioner for economic and financial affairs under three presidents ( rey , malfatti and mansholt ) and later served as prime minister under valéry giscard d'estaing from <year> until <year> . as a candidate for the presidency in <year> , he came in third and was eliminated in the first round . he was born in saint-denis , in the french island of réunion , then still a colony ( it became an overseas department in <year> ) . == career == === professional life === after his education , raymond barre was professor of economics at the institut d'etudes politiques de paris ( sciences po ) as well as école centrale paris . from <year> to <year> , he was director of jean-marcel jeanneney 's staff , in the ministry of industry and trade . then , in <year> , president charles de gaulle chose him as vice-president of the european commission for economic & financial affairs . he stayed in brussels until january <year> , serving in the rey , malfatti and mansholt commissions . having come back to france , he joined the cabinet as minister of the external trade <days> january <year> . === premiership === seven months later , while mostly unknown at that time , president giscard d'estaing appointed him prime minister and minister of economy and finance . he presented him to the french people as `` the best economist in france '' ( french : meilleur économiste de france ) . under the fifth republic , he was the only person to hold these two offices at the same time . he left the ministry of economy and finance in <year> , but stayed as prime minister until the defeat of giscard d'estaing at the <year> presidential election . at the head of the cabinet , he was faced with the conflict which divided the parliamentary majority between the `` giscardians '' and the neo-gaullist rally for the republic ( rpr ) led by his predecessor jacques chirac . the right majority unexpectedly won the <year> legislative election . barre was primarily confronted with an economic crisis . he advocated numerous complex , strict policies ( `` barre plans '' ) . the first barre plan emerged on <integer> september <year> , with a priority to stop inflation . it included a <other> price freeze ; a reduction in the value added tax ; wage controls ; salary controls ; a reduction of the growth in the money supply ; and increases in the income tax , automobile taxes , luxury taxes and bank rates . there were measures to restore the trade balance , and support the growth of the economy and employment . oil imports , whose price had shot up , were limited . there was special aid to exports , and an action fund was set up to aid industries . there was increased financial aid to farmers , who were suffering from a drought , and for social security . the package was not very popular , but was pursued with vigor.in the face of trade union opposition , he did not use diplomatic language . instead he mocked `` the bearers of banners '' ( french : les porteurs de pancartes ) and he exhorted `` instead of grousing , you should work hard '' . === post-premiership === after his departure from the head of the cabinet , he was elected deputy of rhône département under the label of the union for french democracy ( udf ) , although he never formally joined the party . he held his parliamentary seat until <year> . in the 1980s , he competed for the leadership of the right against chirac . believing that the `` cohabitation '' was incompatible with the `` fifth republic '' , he let chirac take the lead of the cabinet after the <year> legislative election . he ran as udf candidate for president in the <year> election , but some components of his party supported covertly the other right-wing candidate , the neo-gaullist prime minister jacques chirac . in this , in spite of positive polls at the beginning of the campaign , he came the third behind the two protagonists of the `` cohabitation '' : the socialist president françois mitterrand and jacques chirac . for the second round , he called his voters to transfer to the rpr candidate , who was finally defeated . after the failure of his presidential candidacy , he focused on his local tenures , in lyon . in <year> , the rpr mayor of lyon michel noir could not compete for another term in due to a judicial indictment , and consequently , barre was the conservative candidate to the mayoralty . he was elected but he did not run for a second term in <year> . one year later , he finished his last parliamentary term in the french national assembly and retired from politics . raymond barre was probably the only french politician to have reached such high levels of responsibilities without having ever been an official member or leader of any political party . he always kept some distance with what he considered to be the political `` microcosm '' . raymond barre died on <integer> august <year> at age <integer> at the val-de-grâce military hospital in paris , where he was being treated for heart problems since his transfer from a hospital in monaco on <integer> april <year> . == political career == governmental functions prime minister : 1976–1981 . minister of economy and finance : 1976–1978 . minister of foreign trade : january–august <year> . electoral mandates national assembly of france member of the national assembly of france for rhône ( department ) : 1981–2002 . elected in <year> , reelected in <year> , <year> , <year> , <year> . municipal council mayor of lyon : 1995–2001 . municipal councillor of lyon : 1995–2001 . urban community council president of the urban community of lyon : 1995–2001 . member of the urban community of lyon : 1995–2001 . bilderberg conference participant <year> == allegations of antisemitism == on several occasions , raymond barre made remarks that were interpreted as antisemitic , or at least supportive of antisemitism . in <year> , when he was prime minister , a bombing was attempted against the union libérale israélite de france , a synagogue in the rue copernic , paris ; however the bomb detonated in the street when the jews attending shabbat were inside the synagogue , and not when they were out ; but as a result some non-jewish bystanders were killed . raymond barre then famously denounced : `` a hateful attack which wanted to strike at the jews who were in that synagogue , and which struck innocent french people who were crossing the street . `` in <year> , barre argued on a radio show that `` the jewish lobby '' had orchestrated criticism regarding his <year> remarks . on this same show , barre defended the collaborationist maurice papon at his trial , describing him as `` a scapegoat .

web page of prof.michał życzkowski rupert riedl ( <integer> february <year> – <integer> september <year> ) was an austrian zoologist . == biography == riedl was a scientist with broad interests , whose influence in epistemology grounded in evolutionary theory was notable , although less in english-speaking circles than in german or even spanish speaking ones . his <year> work , biology of knowledge : the evolutionary basis of reason examined cognitive abilities and the increasing complexity of biological diversification over the immense periods of evolutionary time.riedl built upon the work of the viennese school of thought initially typified by konrad lorenz , and continued in vienna by gerhard vollmer , franz wuketits , and in spain by nicanor ursura . riedl was skeptical of german idealism , and nourished by the tradition that produced the scientists and philosophers of science ernst mach , ludwig boltzmann , erwin schrödinger , karl popper , hans reichenbach and sigmund freud . lorenz believed that the kantian framework of cognitive concepts such as three-dimensional space and time were not fixed but built up over phylogenetic history , potentially subject to further developments . lorenz ’ s position , as expanded by riedl , attempted to make it easier to assimilate non-common sense areas of physics such as quantum field theory and string theory . riedl drew clear distinctions between the deductive and inductive ( non conscious ) cognitive processes characteristic of the left and right cerebral hemispheres . his analysis of what he called `` the pitfalls of reason '' deserves special attention . he , like lorenz , was concerned with cognitive processes that might endanger the future of civilization . riedl had less direct influence on academic philosophy than his profound influence on the thinking of investigators in neuroscience such as michael gazzaniga , antonio damasio , and vilayanur s. ramachandran , whose investigations combine synergistically with those of more physiologically-oriented scientists such as eric kandel and rodolfo llinás , as well as computational models that take advantage of the techniques of systems dynamics as practiced by the physiologists denis noble and p. read montague . riedl contributed to developmental biology , morphology , evolution ( a systems approach ) and evolutionary epistemology . he was the founder president of the club of vienna . == evolutionary views == riedl held the opinion that the modern synthesis of the <other> century had ignored the role of development and morphology in evolution . he argued that the modern synthesis had failed to explain the origin of body plans and patterns at the macroevolutionary level . he presented his evolutionary theory in order in living organisms : a systems analysis of evolution ( translated , <year> ) . he called for an extended evolutionary synthesis to integrate processes from developmental biology and macroevolutionary perspectives . riedl and michael conrad in the 1970s were the first two scientists to propose explicit mechanisms for the evolution of evolvability . == education and teaching == <year> : riedl started studies in fine arts , medicine , anthropology but at the end he obtained a degree in biology with specialization in zoology at the university of vienna in <year> . <year> : assistant

'' three weeks later , young filed formal charges against becker . feeling vulnerable , becker gathered evidence , hired experienced defense counsel louis grant , and rallied the support of his colleagues . becker made a powerful entrance to his trial on october <days> , <year> , surrounded by a phalanx of policemen . commissioner frederick dent grant , son of ulysses s. grant , headed the proceeding . after almost five hours of examination , becker was acquitted . he learned about the power of the badge and how he could call on his colleagues for help . == marriage and family == becker married letitia stenson from ontario , canada . their son , howard p. becker , was born in <year> . six years later the couple divorced , and howard grew up with his mother and stepfather in the west . his mother married charles 's brother paul . howard becker completed a doctorate in sociology at the university of chicago and later became a full professor at university of wisconsin-madison . charles becker married and divorced again . in <year> he married a woman , helen , a schoolteacher and later assistant principal . their daughter , charlotte becker , died less than a day after her birth in <year> . helen becker always believed that her husband was wrongfully convicted of murder . == reform movement == in <year> and <year> , becker was one of the leaders of a patrolman 's reform movement agitating for the introduction of the three-platoon system . it would have significantly reduced the number of hours that the beat police officer was expected to work . in <year> , he was seconded to a special unit working out of police headquarters to probe the alleged corruption of police inspector max f. schmittberger . the inspector had earned enmity among patrolmen for giving detailed testimony to the <year> lexow committee investigating police corruption in new york . partly because of becker 's work , schmittberger was subsequently prosecuted . deputy police commissioner rhinelander waldo was so satisfied with becker 's work that when he was appointed as new york city police commissioner in <year> , waldo appointed becker , now a lieutenant , as head of one of the city 's three anti-vice squads . == criminal activities == becker allegedly used his position to extort substantial sums , later shown to total in excess of $ 100,000 , from manhattan brothels and illegal gambling casinos in exchange for immunity from police interference . percentages of the take were regularly delivered to politicians and other policemen . the area was under the patronage of tammany hall 's leader , big tim sullivan . herman rosenthal , a flamboyant estonian immigrant who ran several illegal casinos in what was known as the tenderloin district , was irritated by a police raid led by becker on one of his casinos and the damage they left . he complained to the press that becker `` collected <integer> percent of the take '' there . <days> july <year> , becker was reported by the new york world as one of three senior police officials involved in extorting money from rosenthal 's casinos . the day that rosenthal was due to testify to a grand jury , he was murdered at <integer> am as he left the hotel metropole at <integer> west 43rd street , just off times square . lefty louie , whitey lewis , dago frank , and gyp the blood were seen to shoot him from their car , making no effort at disguise . they were separately tried , convicted , and sentenced to death and were ultimately executed.manhattan district attorney charles s. whitman , who had made an appointment to interview rosenthal before his death , alleged that the four gangsters had committed the murder at becker 's behest . amid a major public outcry following the murder and extensive press coverage , becker was transferred to the bronx and assigned to desk duty . == arrest , trial , and execution == whitman 's office continued to investigate becker . on july <days> , <year> , becker was arrested at the precinct 's closing hour by special detectives from the district attorney 's office . he was tried and convicted of first-degree murder that fall in a trial presided by john goff , who was `` intensely biased against becker '' and whose charge to the jury was slanted toward conviction . the verdict was overturned on appeal on the grounds that goff had been biased and that there was no independent corroborating witness to testify to the events since all of them had been involved in the crimes.the court ruled for a retrial , but in <year> , becker was convicted again and sentenced to death . he was the first police officer in new york to receive that penalty . becker continued to profess his innocence . the day before his execution , becker told the warden , `` sure , i told them to put rosenthal out of the way , but i did n't mean they should kill him . i wanted them to get him out of town so he would n't blab . killing him was rose 's idea and the others . they wanted to save their own skins . '' jack rose had served as a prosecution witness , as did harry vallon , sam schepps and bridgey webber . they were underworld criminal figures who were believed to be involved in the crime but were promised immunity by the district attorney 's office in exchange for testifying against becker . whitman , who was then governor of new york , signed becker 's death warrant in <year> and attended the execution . becker was executed by the electric chair in sing sing on july <days> , <year> . the process took nine minutes , appearing to cause the man intense agony . for years afterward , it was described as `` the clumsiest execution in the history of sing sing . '' becker is the `` only policeman to be executed for murder in the history of the united states . `` becker was interred at woodlawn cemetery , the bronx , on august <days> , <year> . he was buried next to his daughter . == controversy == beginning with henry klein in <year> , a number of authors have suggested that becker was wrongly convicted . andy logan wrote a thorough account of this position in her against the evidence ( <year> ) , as she became convinced of his innocence in the murder through her research . they suggest that becker and his fellow officers had stood back and allowed `` the street '' to `` take care of '' rosenthal since they knew that his co-operation with the district attorney 's office would put a huge target on his back . three people have been identified as having a major stake of self-interest in becker 's prosecution for murder . allegedly , district attorney whitman manipulated the evidence to implicate the corrupt lieutenant . becker was known to have assets that far exceeded his salary . however , for whitman , gaining a guilty verdict for becker in the sensational murder case would help his own political aspirations , and he is thought to have been elected as governor largely based on his success in that goal.in addition , the reporter herbert bayard swope publicized the case mercilessly in the press , representing the power of the new york world . he devoted much space to the conduct of the trial and individuals ' testimony . later , he said his reporting on the trial catapulted his career . lastly , as noted above , judge john goff showed his bias and played a major role in gaining a guilty verdict from the jury.new york police historian thomas a. reppetto believes that becker was guilty because of the testimony of people involved but also he had a strong motive and had shown reckless behavior . the consensus continues to favor becker 's active involvement in the murder.the becker-rosenthal murder was explored by historian mike dash in his satan 's circus : murder , vice , police corruption and new york 's trial of the century ( <year> ) . he made no conclusion as to becker 's guilt in the murder . == in popular culture == the `` jack rose '' became a popular drink , named after the gambler who was a leading prosecution witness in the becker trial after being given immunity by the district attorney . f. scott fitzgerald had his mob boss character , meyer wolfsheim , describe a fictionalized version of this murder in his novel the great gatsby . the rosenthal murder is featured in harry stein 's novel hoopla ( <year> ) it is featured in kevin baker 's novel dreamland ( <year> ) . it is also featured in michael bookman 's self-published novel god 's rat : jewish mafia on the lower east side ( <year> ) == notes == == references == === books === cohen , stanley ( <year> ) . `` the execution of officer becker ; the murder of a gambler , the trial of a cop , and the birth of organized crime .

november <year> – <integer> july <year> ) was a german ornithologist and curator at the senckenberg-museum in frankfurt . he was a writer of both scientific and popular books on birds and served as editor of the avicultural periodical gefiederte welt . steinbacher was born in hoexter on the river weser and he grew up in goslar in the harz mountains . his interest in natural history as a child was nurtured by his uncle friedrich steinbacher who lived in berlin along with another ornithologist cousin georg . after his gymnasium he spent time at the helgoland bird observatory and later worked on bird migration in the north sea . he went to study at the university of göttingen in <year> and then transferred to berlin . between studies he worked at the rossitten observatory . in <year> he worked along with oskar heinroth and helmut sick to produce a vinyl record of bird songs . he completed his doctoral dissertation under erwin stresemann in <year> on the systematics of the galbulidae and the bucconidae . he spent some years working at the berlin zoo.in <year> he replaced gunther niethammer , who had moved to vienna , as head of the ornithological department at the alexander koenig museum in bonn . after niethammer 's return after the second world war , steinbacher moved to the senckenberg museum where he became curator in 1954.steinbacher published a popular book on bird migration vogelzug und vogelzugforschung in <year> that was translated without his permission into chinese by cheng tso-hsin . a similar russian translation was also produced . steinbacher was awarded the order of merit of the federal republic of germany in <year> . he was also made an honorary inspector for nature conservation in romania in <year> . retiring in <year> he continued to edit the periodical gefiederte welt which he had begun to edit from <year> when he became proficient with captive birds at the berlin zoo . he was also a coeditor for the bird volumes of grzimek 's animal

arthur robert kantrowitz ( october <days> , <year> – november <days> , <year> ) was an american scientist , engineer , and educator . kantrowitz grew up in the bronx and graduated from dewitt clinton high school . he earned his b.s. , m.a . and , in <year> , his ph.d. degrees in physics from columbia university . == early life == kantrowitz was born in new york city on october <days> , <year> . his mother was a costume designer and his father ran a clinic in the bronx . as a child , arthur built an electrocardiograph from old radio parts , working with his brother adrian ( who would go on to perform the first heart transplant in the united states . ) == career == during his graduate studies at columbia , kantrowitz started working as a physicist in <year> for the national advisory committee for aeronautics ( naca ) , work he would continue for ten years . while obtaining his ph.d. , kantrowitz was supervised by edward teller . he went on to teach at cornell university for the next ten years and later founded the avco-everett research lab ( aerl ) in everett , massachusetts , in <year> . he developed shock tubes , which were able to produce the extremely hot gases needed to simulate atmospheric re-entry from orbital speeds , thereby solving the critical nose cone re-entry heating problem and accelerating the development of recoverable spacecraft . he was aerl 's director , chief executive officer , and chairman until <year> when he took on a professorship at dartmouth college . from <year> to <year> he also served as a vice president and director of avco corporation . == scientific contributions == kantrowitz 's interdisciplinary research in the area of fluid mechanics and gas dynamics led to contributions in the field of magnetohydrodynamics and to the development of high-efficiency , high-power lasers . he first suggested a system of laser propulsion to launch bulk payloads into orbit , using energy from ground-based lasers to increase exhaust velocity and thereby reduce the propellant-to-payload mass ratio . his concepts on laser propulsion were published in 1988.his early research included supersonic diffusers and supersonic compressors in the early 40s , which has since been applied to jet engines . he invented the total energy variometer in <year> , used in soaring planes , and is the co-inventor of an early scheme for magnetically contained nuclear fusion , patent application , <year> . in <year> , he invented a technique for producing the supersonic source for molecular beams [ <integer> ] ; this was subsequently used by chemists in research that led to two nobel prizes . in the 1960s and 1970s , he led the design and development at aerl of the first intra-aortic balloon pump . the balloon pump is a temporary cardiac assist device which has been used worldwide on three million people . the device was used on his own failing heart . another contribution to science was the stagnation-point flow experiment in which processes of initial interaction of fresh flowing blood with an artificial surface can be directly visualized under a high-power microscope . this technique has become an important method for experimentally studying this vital interaction and led to a variety of circulatory prostheses , including the artificial heart . kantrowitz , as an advocate of the separation of science and technology from political or ideological concerns , first proposed in <year> the creation of an institution for scientific judgment , commonly referred to as the science court , to assess the state of knowledge in scientific controversies of importance to public policy . he further developed the science court as its task force chairman in president ford 's advisory group on anticipated advances in science and technology , 1975–1976 . according to jerry pournelle , `` we could have developed all this [ i.e . large scale commercial space development ] in the 60s and 70s , but we went another path . arthur kantrowitz tried to convince kennedy 's people that the best way to the moon was through development of manned space access , a von braun manned space station , and on to the moon in a logical way that left developed space assets . '' === kantrowitz limit === kantrowitz is known for development of a theoretical concept of fluid choke points at supersonic and near-supersonic inlet velocities . the concept has become known as the kantrowitz limit . ==== technical description ==== ==== applications ==== the kantrowitz limit has many applications in the gas dynamics of inlet flow for jet engines and rockets , both when operating at high-subsonic and supersonic velocities . two examples will explain the effect of the kantrowitz limit on a nozzle . for both cases , mass flow rate = inlet velocity multiplied by area multiplied by density . consider a nozzle connected to a vacuum source . as the pressure ratio gets to about <integer> , the flow through the nozzle will approach the local speed of sound , and the flow becomes choked flow . when the absolute pressure of the vacuum is decreased further , the flow speed will not increase . this is the kantrowitz limit , which limits the mass flow because the velocity is limited to the speed of sound , and the area , inlet pressure and density are all fixed . aircraft jet engines are very much affected by this limit , once the inlet flow speed gets to mach <integer> the mass flow rate is limited , regardless of how much suction the engine creates . next , consider the nozzle connected to a compressed air supply . with a pressure ratio of about <integer> , the flow becomes choked , and can not exceed the speed of sound . but the density and resultant mass flow rate can be increased by increasing the inlet pressure . the greater the pressure , the greater the density , and the greater the mass flow . so , while kantrowitz limits the maximum gas velocity , it does not apply any fixed limit to the mass flow rate . a recent high-speed transportation option for rapid transit between populous city-pairs about 1,000 miles ( 1,600 km ) apart , the hyperloop , has the kantrowitz limit as a fundamental design criterion . attempting to pass a high-speed passenger-pod through a very low pressure tube runs squarely into the kantrowitz fluid flow limit . historically , the solutions to working within the limit have been `` go fast '' and `` go slow '' . a major innovation in the hyperloop proposal provides a novel third approach to remain below the kantrowitz limit while still moving at high-subsonic velocities : adding a front-end inlet compressor to actively transfer high-pressure air from the front to the rear of the high-speed transport capsule , and thus bypassing much of the air that would have resulted in the dynamic shock of the choked flow . the flow in the smaller duct through the capsule is also subject to the kantrowitz limit , this is relieved by increasing the pressure and the density to achieve the required mass flow . in the hyperloop alpha design of <year> , the air-inlet pump also provides a low-friction air-bearing suspension system for traveling at over <integer> mph ( 1,100 km/h ) . == honors and awards == kantrowitz was a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences , american association for the advancement of science , american astronautical society , american institute of aeronautics and astronautics ( honorary ) , american physical society , american institute for medical and biological engineering and member of the national academy of engineering and national academy of sciences and international academy of astronautics . in 1953–1954 , he held both fulbright and guggenheim fellowships at cambridge and manchester universities . kantrowitz was an honorary trustee of the university of rochester , an honorary life member of the board of governors of the technion , and an honorary professor of the huazhong institute of technology , wuhan , china . kantrowitz also served on the board of advisors for the foresight institute , an organization devoted to preparing for nanotechnology . kantrowitz held <integer> patents and wrote or co-authored more than <integer> scientific and professional papers and articles . he also co-authored fundamentals of gas dynamics , <year> , princeton univ . press . kantrowitz died at age <integer> , november <days> , <year> , while visiting relatives in new york . he had suffered a heart attack on the previous day . == see also == hyperloop pod competition – practical ground transport vehicle prototypes dealing with the kantrowitz limit == references == `` biographies of aerospace officials and policymakers , k-n '' . nasa history division . archived from the original on <integer> september <year> . retrieved <days> . johnson , john , jr.

century . his work focuses on development and underdevelopment and on the persistence of poverty in peripheral countries throughout the world . he is viewed , along with raúl prebisch , as one of the main formulators of economic structuralism , an economics school that is largely identified with cepal , which achieved prominence in latin america and other developing regions during the 1960s and 1970s and sought to stimulate economic development through governmental intervention , largely inspired on the views of john maynard keynes . as a politician , furtado was appointed minister of planning ( goulart government ) and minister of culture ( sarney government ) . == biography == born in pombal , a city set in the semi-arid region of the state of paraíba , celso furtado moved to rio de janeiro in <year> , to study law , and graduated from the federal university of rio de janeiro ( ufrj ) in <year> . that same year , he was conscripted to the brazilian expeditionary force to fight in italy , during world war ii , alongside the allies . seeing countries destroyed in post-war europe had a profound impact on him , leading to the decision that he would study economics : he enrolled in a doctorate program at the university of paris ( sorbonne ) , in <year> , and presented a thesis on the economy of brazil during the colonial period . in <year> , he moved to santiago , chile , where he joined the team of the newly created united nations economic commission for latin america and the caribbean ( best known by its latin american acronym , cepal ) , which was then headed by argentine economist raúl prebisch . while working at cepal , furtado and prebisch were decisive for the formulation of socioeconomic policies for the development of latin america which emphasized industrialization and import substitution . upon his return to brazil in <year> , he published his most famous book – the economic growth of brazil : a survey from colonial to modern times ( in portuguese : formação econômica do brasil ) – and was appointed the director of the brazilian development bank ( bnde ) in charge of issues concerning states of the northeastern region , which are poor and face chronic droughts and desertification . during this period , he developed a plan which resulted in the creation of the superintendency for the development of the northeast ( sudene ) , a governmental agency that worked to stimulate economic growth in that region , and was appointed by brazilian president juscelino kubitschek ( 1956–1961 ) the agency 's first director . during the government of president joão goulart ( 1961–1964 ) , furtado became minister of planning and was responsible for brazil 's triennial plan of development . furtado was also one of the founders of the united nations conference on trade and development ( unctad ) , an intergovernmental body created in <year> , whose work has since centered around issues related to development and the asymmetries of international trade . with the brazilian military coup d'état , in <year> , he was forced into exile and worked as professor at yale university , in the united states , and later at cambridge university and the university of paris ( sorbonne ) , in france . after the law of amnesty , in <year> , he returned to brazil and was appointed ambassador of brazil at the eec , in brussels ( 1985–1986 ) and minister of culture in the government of president josé sarney ( 1985–1990 ) . in <year> , celso furtado was nominated to the nobel prize of economics ( bank of sweden prize in

economic development versus the need natural resources for economic processes : it 's a myth to think that economic development , and its benefits , will some day reach everyone in the world if the model of economic development does not change . for instance , there are not sufficient natural resources available for every person in the world if one considers the economic model on which economy was based in the 1970s and is also based currently , i.e . the model where consumerism and individualism are the base for corporate actions . for instance , if every person had money to buy a car , our cities would be completely frozen . the critics on the myths of economic development were based on a report for the club of rome , which is summarized in abstract of the limits to growth : a

massachusetts public school system and the organist and choirmaster of st. catherine 's church in norwood . vincent dethier 's uncles were noted musicians — edouard dethier was a violinist and gaston dethier was an organist and composer . both taught at the juilliard school for many years . although vincent dethier was the first of his father 's family to become a scientist , he retained a lifelong interest in baroque music and played in a recorder quartet during his years at the university of massachusetts.in his <year> autobiographical essay `` curiosity , milieu and era '' , dethier attributed his interest in insects , which would become a central aspect of his research career , to a childhood encounter with a butterfly in a neighborhood park known as `` the oval '' : i had wandered up to the oval late one hot , humid , summer day . the long , slanting rays of the sun illuminated my white shirt . suddenly , something rocketed across the street , made a few zigzags , and landed on my shirt , just above the pocket . i stood stock-still and slowly lowered my head to see what it was . there with its wings slowly expanding clung a brown butterfly with a red band extending down each wing . this red admiral was the first live butterfly i had ever seen at close range , and i was fascinated . dethier received his undergraduate degree from harvard university and went on to obtain his phd there in <year> . his research in the 1930s was on the feeding habits of swallowtail butterfly caterpillars . he became the first to prove that food is selected by caterpillars not by a plant 's nutritional value but by its taste and smell . his first post-doctoral position was as a biology instructor at john carroll university in cleveland , ohio where he taught from <year> to <year> . with the outbreak of world war ii , he joined the army air corps , serving part of his time in africa and middle east . he wrote his first book , chemical insect attractants and repellents ,

groups of the greek resistance ( eam/elas ) against the axis occupation , the establishment of the national health system and the supreme council for personnel selection ( asep ) , the passage of law <other> which secured the right to strike and greatly improved the rights of workers , the constitutional amendment of 1985–1986 which strengthened parliamentarism and reduced the powers of the indirectly-elected president , the conduct of an assertive and independent greek foreign policy , the expansion in the power of local governments , many progressive reforms in greek law and the granting of permission to the refugees of the greek civil war , of greek ethnicity , to return home in greece.the panhellenic socialist movement ( pasok ) , which he founded and led , was the first non-communist political party in greek history with a mass-based organization , introducing an unprecedented level of political and social participation in greek society . in a poll conducted by kathimerini in <year> , <integer> % of those polled called papandreou the `` most important greek prime minister '' . in the same poll , the first four years of papandreou 's government after metapolitefsi were voted as the best government greece ever had . his father , georgios papandreou , and his son , george papandreou have both also served as prime ministers of greece . == early life and career == papandreou was born on the island of chios , greece , the son of zofia ( sofia ) mineyko ( 1883–1981 ) and the leading greek liberal politician george papandreou . his maternal grandfather was polish-lithuanian-born public figure zygmunt mineyko , and his maternal grandmother was greek . before university he attended athens college , a leading private school in greece . he attended the national and kapodistrian university of athens from <year> until <year> when , during the authoritarian , right-leaning metaxas dictatorship , he was arrested for purported trotskyism . following representations by his father , he was allowed to leave for the us.in <year> , papandreou received a phd degree in economics from harvard university . immediately after getting his doctorate , papandreou joined america 's war effort and volunteered for the us navy , serving as an examiner of models for repairing warships , and as a hospital corpsman at the bethesda naval hospital for war wounded . he returned to harvard in <year> and served as a lecturer and associate professor until <year> . he then held professorships at the university of minnesota , northwestern university , the university of california , berkeley ( where he was chair of the department of economics ) , stockholm university and york university in toronto where he worked alongside long term advisor professor christos paraskevopoulos . === personal life === he was married to christina rasia from <year> to <year> . in <year> , he entered into a relationship with university of minnesota journalism student margaret chant , born in <year> , daughter of douglas chant and wife hulda pfund.after chant obtained a divorce , and after his own divorce from his first wife christina rasia , papandreou and chant were married in <year> . they had three sons and a daughter . papandreou also had , with swedish actress and tv presenter ragna nyblom , a daughter out of wedlock , emilia nyblom , who was born in <year> in sweden.papandreou divorced his second wife margaret chant in <year> , and married dimitra liani who was <integer> years his junior . he died in <year> . his will generated much discussion because he left everything to his <other> third wife . he left nothing to his second wife , to whom he was married to for <integer> years , their four children , or his illegitimate swedish daughter . == political career == papandreou returned to greece in <year> , where he headed an economic development research program , by invitation of prime minister konstantinos karamanlis . in <year> , he was appointed chairman of the board of directors , general director of the athens economic research center , and advisor to the bank of greece . in <year> , his father george papandreou , head of the center union , became prime minister of greece . andreas became his chief economic advisor . he renounced his american citizenship and was elected to the greek parliament in the <year> greek legislative election . he immediately became minister to the first ministry of state ( in effect , assistant prime minister ) . papandreou took publicly a neutral stand during the cold war and wished for greece to be more independent from the united states . he also criticized the massive presence of american military and intelligence in greece , and sought to remove senior officers with anti-democratic tendencies from the greek military . he disagreed also with the american policy on the cyprus dispute . in <year> , while the `` aspida '' conspiracy within the hellenic army ( alleged by the political opposition to involve andreas personally ) was being investigated , georgios papandreou decided to remove the defense minister and assume the post himself . constantine ii of greece refused to endorse this move and essentially forced george papandreou 's resignation during the events of the apostasia of <year> . greece entered a period of political polarisation and instability which ended with the coup d'état of <integer> april <year> . when the greek colonels led by georgios papadopoulos seized power <days> april <year> , andreas was incarcerated . gust avrakotos , a high- ranking cia officer in greece who was close to the colonels who led the coup , advised them to `` shoot the motherfucker because he 's going to come back to haunt you '' . his father george papandreou was put under house arrest . george , already at advanced age , died in <year> . under heavy pressure from american academics and intellectuals , such as john kenneth galbraith , a friend of andreas since their harvard days , the military regime released andreas on condition that he leave the country . papandreou then moved to sweden with his wife , four children , and mother . there he accepted a post at stockholm university . in paris , while in exile , andreas papandreou formed an anti-dictatorship organization , the panhellenic liberation movement ( pak ) , and toured the world rallying opposition to the greek military regime . despite his former american citizenship and academic career in the united states , papandreou held the central intelligence agency responsible for the <year> coup and became increasingly critical of the federal government of the united states , often stating that greece was under `` us occupation '' . in the early 1970s , during the latter phase of the dictatorship in greece , papandreou , along with most leading greek politicians in exile or in greece , opposed the process of political normalisation attempted by georgios papadopoulos and his appointed pm , spyros markezinis . on <integer> august <year> , andreas papandreou called an extraordinary meeting of the national congress of pak in winterthur , switzerland , which decided its dissolution without announcing it publicly.papandreou returned to greece after the events in cyprus and the fall of the junta in <year> , during metapolitefsi . he was offered the leadership of his father 's old party , which had evolved into centre union – new forces . however , he not only turned it down , but rejected his father 's ideological heritage as a venizelist liberal , declaring himself a democratic socialist . to that end , he formed a new `` radical '' party , the panhellenic socialist movement ( pasok ) . most of his former pak companions , as well as members of other leftist groups such as the democratic defense joined in the new party . he also testified in the first of the greek junta trials about the alleged involvement of the junta with the central intelligence agency ( cia ) . in the <year> elections , pasok received only 13.5 % of the vote , but in <year> it polled <integer> % , and papandreou became leader of the opposition . === the `` change '' === at the <year> elections , pasok won a landslide victory over the conservative new democracy party , and papandreou became greece 's first socialist prime minister . the party 's main slogan was allagí ( change ) . in office , papandreou backtracked from much of his campaign rhetoric and followed a more conventional approach . greece did not withdraw from nato , united states troops and military bases were not ordered out of greece , and greek membership in the european economic community continued , largely because papandreou proved very capable of securing monetary aid for greece . in domestic affairs , papandreou 's government immediately carried out a massive programme of wealth redistribution upon coming into office that immediately increased the availability of entitlement aid to the unemployed and lower wage earners . pensions , together with average wages and the minimum wage , were increased in real terms , and changes were made to labour laws which up until <year> made it difficult for employers to make workers redundant . the impact of the pasok government 's social and economic policies was such that it was estimated in <year> that two-thirds of the decrease in inequality that occurred in greece between <year> and <year> took place between <year> and 1982.during its time in office , papandreou 's government carried through sweeping reforms of social policy by introducing a welfare state , significantly expanding welfare measures , expanding health care coverage ( the `` national health system '' was instituted , which made modern medical procedures available in rural areas for the first time , ) promoting state-subsidized tourism ( social tourism ) for lower-income families , index-linking pensions , and funding social establishments for the elderly . rural areas benefited from improved state services , the rights and income of low paid workers were considerably improved , and refugees from the civil war living in exile were allowed to return with impunity . he also officially recognized the role of leftist partisan groups in the greek resistance during the axis occupation . the first law recognizing the greek resistance was passed in <year> excluding partisan groups that fought against the greek state in the greek civil war ( a.n . <integer> ) in <year> his government passed the <year> law that abolished this exception.a more progressive taxation scheme was introduced and budgetary support for artistic and cultural programmes was increased . the government also introduced a wage indexation system which helped to close the gap modestly between the highest and lowest paid workers , while the share of gnp devoted to social welfare , social insurance , and health was significantly increased . other major policy changes included the establishment of parental leave for both parents and child care centres , maternity allowances , community health centres , and the encouragement of women to join agricultural cooperatives as full members , an option which previously had not been open to women.as part of papandreou 's `` social contract '' , new liberalising laws were introduced which decriminalised adultery , abolished ( in theory ) the dowry system , eased the process for obtaining a divorce , and enhanced the legal status of women . in <year> , for instance , women were guaranteed equal pay for equal work . papandreou also introduced various reforms in the administration and curriculum of the greek educational system , allowing students to participate in the election process for their professors and deans in the university , and abolishing tenure . the university system was expanded , with the number of students doubling between <year> and <year> , while the system was reorganised to provide the departments with more power and permit greater participation in their management . the effect of these reforms was however , limited by poor research facilities , a shortage of qualified teaching staff , a lack of resources , and often inefficient administration.in a move strongly opposed by the church of greece , papandreou introduced , for the first time in greece , the process of civil marriage . prior to the institution of civil marriages in greece , the only legally recognized marriages were those conducted in the church of greece . couples seeking a civil marriage had to get married outside greece , generally in italy . under pasok , the greek state also appropriated real estate properties previously owned by the church . a major part of papandreou 's allagi ( `` change '' ) involved driving out the `` old families '' ( tzákia , literally `` hearths '' , using the traditional greek expression for the genealogy of families ) , which dominated greek politics and economy and belonged to the traditional greek right . papandreou was comfortably re-elected in the <year> greek legislative election with <integer> % of the vote , and won still further popularity <days> march <year> by his strong leadership during the <year> greek-turkish crisis in the aegean sea . however , from the summer of <year> , his premiership became increasingly clouded by controversy , as the bank of crete scandal exploded . in <year> , he divorced his wife margaret papandreou and married dimitra liani ( florina , <integer> april <year> ) , without issue . === `` koskotas scandal '' , trial and return to power === in <year> , after the arrest of george koskotas in the us , he was indicted by the hellenic parliament in connection with a us $ <integer> million bank of crete embezzlement scandal , and was accused of facilitating the embezzlement by ordering state corporations to transfer their holdings to the bank of crete , where the interest was allegedly skimmed off to benefit pasok , and possibly some of its highest functionaries . following the many repercussions of the so-called koskotas scandal , pasok was roundly defeated at the june <year> elections , losing <integer> seats in one of the largest defeats of a sitting government in modern greek history . however , due to changes made in electoral law one year before the elections by the then reigning pasok administration , new democracy was not able to form a government despite finishing with the most seats . the new law required a party to win <integer> percent of the vote to govern alone , and nd had come up just short of that threshold . as a result , even though new democracy finished <integer> seats ahead of pasok , it was unable to garner support from the five mps it needed to make its leader , konstantinos mitsotakis , prime minister . the ensuing deadlock led to fresh elections <days> november <year> greek legislative election . papandreou 's pasok 's won <integer> % of the popular vote , compared to the rival new democracy 's <integer> % . as before , even though new democracy finished well ahead of pasok in seat count , it was not able to form a government . a third election in <year> followed , and mitsotakis eventually received enough support to form a government . in the wake of three consecutive elections between <year> and <year> , the new democracy leader , constantine mitsotakis , eventually received sufficient support to form a government . <days> january <year> , papandreou himself was cleared of any wrongdoing in the koskotas scandal after a 7–6 vote in the specially convened supreme special court trial . after <integer> years of mitsotakis ' government , papandreou and pasok won again the <year> election , and returned to power ; in <year> , his government decided to impose an economic embargo on the republic of macedonia . in <year> , an interim accord was signed between the two countries . however , his fragile health kept him from exercising firm political leadership . he was hospitalized with advanced heart disease and renal failure on <integer> november <year> and finally retired from office on <integer> january <year> . he died on <integer> june <year> , with his funeral procession producing crowds , ranging from `` hundreds of thousands '' to `` millions '' to bid farewell to andreas . in <year> , papandreou was posthumously awarded the swedish order of the polar star . == economic policies == the expenditure programme of the papandreou government during 1981–1990 has been described as excessive by its conservative critics . the excessive expenditures were not accompanied by corresponding revenue increases and this led to increases in budget deficits and the public debt . many economic indicators worsened during 1981–1990 and the economic policies of his government were condemned as a failure by his critics . various nationalizations of enterprises and the increase of the public sector was another point of critic by the conservatives . on the other hand , according to his supporters they were successful , drastically increasing the purchasing power of the vast majority of greeks , with personal incomes growing by <integer> % in real terms during the course of the 1980s . papandreou 's increased spending in his early years in power ( 1981–1985 ) was necessary in order to heal the deep wounds of the greek society , a society that was still deeply divided by the brutal memories of the civil war and the right-wing repression that followed ; furthermore , the postwar government philosophy of the greek conservatives simply saw the state as a tool of repression , with very little money spent on health or education . furthermore , papandreou 's governments managed to handle the inflation and unemployment rate , maintain the growth of the economy , while according to his supporters the external debt in <year> was in normal levels ( around <integer> % of gdp ) . == international politics == papandreou was praised for conducting an independent and multidimensional foreign policy , and proved to be a master of the diplomatic game , thus increasing the importance of greece in the international system . he was co-creator in <year> of , and subsequently an active participant in , a movement promoted by the parliamentarians for global action , the initiative of the six , which included , besides the greek pm , mexico 's president miguel de la madrid , argentina 's president raúl alfonsín , sweden 's prime minister olof palme , tanzania 's president julius nyerere and india 's prime minister indira gandhi . the movement 's stated objective was the `` promotion of peace and progress for all mankind '' . after various initiatives , mostly directed at pressuring the united states and the soviet union to stop nuclear testing and reduce the level of nuclear arms , it eventually disbanded.papandreou 's rhetoric was at times antagonistic to the united states . he was the first western prime minister to visit general wojciech jaruzelski in poland . according to the foreign affairs magazine papandreou went on record as saying that since the ussr is not a capitalist country `` one can not label it an imperialist power . '' according to papandreou , `` the soviet union represent [ ed ] a factor that restrict [ ed ] the expansion of capitalism and its imperialistic aims '' . this antagonistic stance made him extremely popular , because the previous conservative governments were seen by the greek people as slavishly loyal to us interests.papandreou 's government was the first in post-war greece that redirected the nation 's defense policy to suit its own security needs , and not those of the united states . according to historian marion sarafis , from <year> until <year> , the us had more influence in greece 's military policy than the indigenous greek high command , largely due to the decisive role played by the us in the greek civil war.papandreou supported the causes of various national liberation movements in the world , and agreed for greece to host representatives offices of many such organisations . he also supported the cause of palestinian liberation , met repeatedly with plo chairman yasser arafat and condemned israeli policies in the occupied territories . he was a supporter of the two-state solution for the conflict . == papandreou 's image and influence in greek popular culture == among both his supporters and his opponents , papandreou was referred to simply by his first name , `` andreas '' , a unique situation in greek political history , and a testament to his charisma and popularity . andreas was also famous for wearing his business suits with turtleneck sweaters ( ζιβάγκο in greek ) , instead of the traditional white shirt and tie ; he thus created a huge fashion , mainly but not exclusively among his political supporters . his first appearance in the greek parliament with a black turtleneck instead of shirt and tie caused a massive uproar in the conservative press , who considered him disrespectful of parliament ; however , the whole issue only added to his popularity . == legacy == papandreou exercised a more independent foreign policy elevating greece 's profile among non-aligned nations . he affirmed greece 's independence in setting her own policy agenda , both internally and externally , free from any foreign domination . his opponents on the left , on the other hand , including the communist party of greece ( kke ) , accused him of supporting , in practice , the agenda of nato and the united states . andreas papandreou is widely acknowledged as having shifted political power from the traditional conservative greek right , which had dominated greek politics for decades , to a more populist and centre-left locus . this included the so-called pariahs in politics as of the end of the greek civil war , which were given a chance to prove themselves in democratically elected governments . this shift in the greek political landscape helped heal some of the old civil war wounds ; greece became more pluralistic , and more in line with the political system of other western european countries . papandreou also systematically pursued inclusionist politics which ended the sociopolitical and economic exclusion of many social classes in the post-civil war era.it is also acknowledged that papandreou , along with karamanlis , played a leading role in establishing democracy in greece during metapolitefsi . he is described as both prudent and a realist , despite his appearance as a leftist ideologue , and charismatic orator . his choices to remain in the european union and nato , both of which he vehemently opposed for many years , proved his pragmatic approach . even his approach of negotiating the removal of the us bases from greece was diplomatic , because although it was agreed to remove them , some of the bases remained . his skillful handling of these difficult policies had the effect of providing common policy goals to the political forces of greece . complementing this political realism , andreas ' ability to publicly say no to the americans gave greeks a sense of national independence and psychological self-worth . perhaps his most important achievement was the establishment of political equality among greeks ; during his years in power the defeated left-wingers of the civil war were no longer treated like second-class citizens and a vital part of national memory was reclaimed.papandreou 's successor in office , costas simitis , broke with a number of papandreou 's approaches . papandreou 's son , george papandreou , was elected leader of pasok <days> february <year> and prime minister during the october <year> general elections . a common slogan among pasok followers in political rallies , invokes andreas ' legacy with the chant `` andrea , zis ! esi mas odigis ! '' ( `` andreas , you are still alive ! you 're leading us ! '' ) . in two separate polls , conducted in <year> and <year> , andreas papandreou was voted as the best prime minister of greece since the restoration of democracy in <year> . === theodore katsanevas === until their divorce in <year> , papandreou 's daughter sofia was married to the academic and politician theodore katsanevas . in papandreou 's will , he accused katsanevas of being a `` disgrace to the family '' ( greek : όνειδος της οικογένειας ) and claimed that `` his aim was to politically inherit the history of struggle of georgios papandreou and andreas papandreou '' . == works == the location and scope of the entrepreneurial function , harvard university , <year> economics and the social sciences , economic journal , <year> an experimental test of an axiom in the theory of choice , econometrica , <year> competition and its regulation , prentice-hall , <year> a test of a stochastic theory of choice , econometrica , <year> economics as a science , lippincott , <year> fundamentals of model construction in macro-economics , center of economic research , <year> a strategy for greek economic development , center of economic research , <year> democracy and national rebirth , fexis , athens , <year> the political element in economic development , almqvist & wiksell , <year> toward a totalitarian world ? , norstedts , stockholm , <year> man 's freedom , columbia university press , new york , <year> democracy at gunpoint : the greek front ( i dimokratia sto apospasma ) , doubleday & co. , new york , <year> paternalistic capitalism , the university of minnesota press , <year> economic development - rhetoric and reality , the university of british columbia , vancouver , <year> project selection for national plans , praeger publishers , new york , <year> the impact approach to project selection , praeger publishers , new york , <year> the method of repercussions in investment selection , praeger publishers , new york , <year> imperialism and economic development , athens , <year> greece to the greeks , athens , <year> transition to socialism , athens , <year> mediterranean socialism , lerici , cosenza , <year> == decorations and awards == knight grand cross of the order of isabella the catholic ( <year> ) order of the polar star ( <year> ) == references == == further reading == clogg , richard . `` andreas papandreou–a political profile .

( pamela was later married to sir david hunt , who served as private secretary to prime ministers clement attlee and winston churchill . ) his father , a christian maronite , became a naturalised british citizen and worked for a british dental supplies manufacturer that sent him to brazil as an agent . ( he later described his father 's profession as selling `` false teeth in south america '' . ) his status as a british citizen was acquired at birth , as he said , `` my birth was registered at the british consulate in good time to acquire the status of 'natural-born british subject ' . `` medawar left brazil with his family for england `` towards the end of the war '' , and he lived there for the rest of his life . he was also a brazilian citizen by birth , as dictated by the brazilian nationality law ( jus soli ) . at <integer> years , when he was of age to be drafted in the brazilian army , he applied for exemption of military conscription to joaquim pedro salgado filho , his godfather and the then minister of aviation . his application was denied by general eurico gaspar dutra , and he had to renounce his brazilian citizenship.in <year> , medawar went to marlborough college in marlborough , wiltshire . he hated the college because `` they were critical and querulous at the same time , wondering what kind of person a lebanese was—something foreign you can be sure '' . and also because of its preference on sports , in which he was weak . an experience of bullying and racism made him feel the rest of his life `` resentful and disgusted at the manners and mores of [ marlborough 's ] essentially tribal institution , '' and likened it to the training schools for the nazi ss as all `` founded upon the twin pillars of sex and sadism . '' his proudest moments at the college were with his teacher ashley gordon lowndes , to whom he credited the beginning of his career in biology . he recognised lowndes as barely literate but `` a very , very good biology teacher '' . lowndes had taught eminent biologists including john z . young and richard julius pumphrey . yet medawar was inherently weak in dissection and was constantly irked by their dictum : `` bloody foolish is the boy whose drawing of his dissection differs in any way whatsoever from the diagram in the textbook . `` in <year> , he went on to magdalen college , oxford , graduating with a first-class honours degree in zoology in <year> . medawar was appointed christopher welch scholar and senior demy of magdalen in <year> . he also worked at the sir william dunn school of pathology supervised by howard florey ( later nobel laureate , and who inspired him to take up immunology ) and completed his doctoral thesis in <year> . in <year> , he became fellow of magdalen through an examination , the position he held till <year> . it was there that he started working with j . z . young on the regeneration of nerves . his invention of a nerve glue proved useful in surgical operations of severed nerves during the world war ii.the university of oxford approved his doctor of philosophy thesis titled `` growth promoting and growth inhibiting factors in normal and abnormal development '' in <year> , but because of the prohibitive cost of supplication ( the process by which the degree is officially conferred ) , he spent the money on his urgent appendectomy instead . the university of oxford later awarded him a doctor of science degree in <year> . == career and research == after completing his phd , medawar was appointed a rolleston prizeman in <year> , senior research fellow of st john 's college , oxford , in <year> , and a university demonstrator in zoology and comparative anatomy , also in <year> . he was re-elected fellow of magdalen from <year> to <year> . in <year> , he became mason professor of zoology at the university of birmingham and worked there till <year> . he transferred to the university college london in <year> as jodrell professor of zoology and comparative anatomy.in <year> , he was appointed director of the national institute for medical research . his predecessor sir charles harrington was an able administrator such that taking over his post was , as he described , `` [ n ] o more strenuous than ... sliding over into the driving-seat of a rolls-royce '' . he was head of the transplantation section of the medical research council 's clinical research centre at harrow from <year> to <year> . he became professor of experimental medicine at the royal institution ( 1977–1983 ) , and president of the royal postgraduate medical school ( 1981–1987 ) . === immunology === medawar 's first scientific research was on the effect of malt on the development of connective tissue cells ( mesenchyme ) in chicken . reading the draft of the manuscript , howard florey commented that it was more philosophical than scientific . it was published in the quarterly journal of experimental physiology in 1937.medawar 's involvement with what became transplant research began during world war ii , when he investigated possible improvements in skin grafts . his first publication on the subject was `` sheets of pure epidermal epithelium from human skin '' , which was published in nature in <year> . his studies particularly concerned solution for skin wounds among soldiers in the war . in <year> , he moved to the university of birmingham , taking along with him his phd student leslie brent and postdoctoral fellow rupert billingham . his research became more focused in <year> , when australian biologist frank macfarlane burnet , at the walter and eliza hall institute of medical research in melbourne , advanced the hypothesis that during embryonic life and immediately after birth , cells gradually acquire the ability to distinguish between their own tissue substances on the one hand and unwanted cells and foreign material on the other.with billingham , he published a seminal paper in <year> on grafting technique . santa j. ono , the american immunologist , has described the enduring impact of this paper to modern science . based on this technique of grafting , medawar 's team devised a method to test burnet 's hypothesis . they extracted cells from young mouse embryos and injected them into another mouse of different strains . when the mouse developed into adult and skin grafting from that of the original strain was performed , there was no tissue rejection . meaning that the mouse had tolerated the foreign tissue , which would normally be rejected . their experimental proof of burnet 's hypothesis was first published in a brief article in nature in <year> , followed by a series of papers , and a comprehensive description in philosophical transactions of the royal society b in <year> , giving the name `` actively acquired tolerance '' . ==== research outcomes ==== medawar was awarded his nobel prize in <year> with burnet for their work in tissue grafting which is the basis of organ transplants , and their discovery of acquired immunological tolerance . this work was used in dealing with skin grafts required after burns . medawar 's work resulted in a shift of emphasis in the science of immunology from one that attempts to deal with the fully developed immunity mechanism to one that attempts to alter the immunity mechanism itself , as in the attempt to suppress the body 's rejection of organ transplants . it directly laid the foundation for the first successful organ transplantation in humans , specifically kidney transplantation , carried out by an american physician joseph murray , who eventually received the <year> nobel prize in physiology or medicine . === theory of senescence === medawar 's <year> lecture an unsolved problem of biology ( published <year> ) addressed ageing and senescence , and he begins by defining both terms as follows : we obviously need a word for mere ageing , and i propose to use 'ageing ' itself for just that purpose . 'ageing ' hereafter stands for mere ageing , and has no other innuendo . i shall use the word 'senescence ' to mean ageing accompanied by that decline of bodily faculties and sensibilities and energies which ageing colloquially entails . he then tackles the question of why evolution has permitted organisms to senesce , even though ( <integer> ) senescence lowers individual fitness , and ( <integer> ) there is no obvious necessity for senescence . in answering this question , medawar provides two fundamental and interrelated insights . first , there is an inexorable decline in probability of an organism 's existence , and , therefore , in what he terms `` reproductive value . '' he suggests that it therefore follows that the force of natural selection weakens progressively with age late in life ( because the fecundity of younger age-groups is overwhelmingly more significant in producing the next generation ) . what happens to an organism after reproduction is only weakly reflected in natural selection by the effect on its younger relatives . he pointed out that likelihood of death at various times of life , as judged by life tables , was an indirect measure of fitness , that is , the capacity of an organism to propagate its genes . life tables for humans show , for example that the lowest likelihood of death in human females comes at about age <integer> , which in primitive societies would likely be an age of peak reproduction . this has served as the basis for all three modern theories for the evolution of senescence . === theory on endocrine evolution === medawar presented a talk on viviparity in animals ( the phenomenon by which some animals give live birth ) at a meeting on evolution at oxford <days> july <year> . later published in <year> , he introduced an aphorism : endocrine evolution is not an evolution of hormones but an evolution of the uses to which they are put ; an evolution not , to put it crudely , of chemical formulae but of reactivities , reaction patterns and tissue competences.the notion that evolution and diversity of endocrine function in animals are due to different uses of each hormone rather than different hormones themselves became an established fact . the paper is also regarded as a pioneer in the field of reproductive immunology . == personal life == medawar never knew the exact meaning of his surname , an arabic word , he was told , for `` to make round '' ; but which a friend explained to him as `` little round fat man '' .medawar married jean shinglewood taylor on <integer> february <year> . they met while in graduate class at oxford , he at magdalene and taylor at somerville college . taylor approached him for the meaning of `` heuristic '' , which she had to ask twice , and he had to finally offer lessons in philosophy . medawar described her as `` the most beautiful woman in oxford '' ; but taylor 's impression was he looked `` mildly diabolical . '' taylor 's family objected to their marriage as medawar had `` no background , and no money . '' her mother was explicitly afraid of having `` black '' grandchildren ; her aunt disinherited her . the couple had two sons , charles and alexander , and two daughters , caroline and louise . medawar was interested in a wide range of subjects including opera , philosophy and cricket . he was exceptionally tall , <integer> ft and <integer> inches , physically robust , with a big voice noted particularly during his lectures . he was renowned for wit and humour , which he claimed he inherited from his `` raucous '' mother . as he completed his phd research in <year> , he did not receive the degree as he could not afford the requisite £25 , to which he commented : i 'm an impostor . i am a doctor , but not a phd ... morally i 'm a phd , in the sense i could have had one if i 'd been able to afford it . anyway it was unfashionable in my day . john young [ probably referring to john zachary young ] was not a phd either . a phd was regarded then as a newfangled german importation , as bizarre and undesirable as having german bands playing on streetcorners . '' he was regarded as the philosopher karl popper 's best-known disciple in science.medawar was the maternal grandfather of the screenwriter and director alex garland . === views on religion === medawar declared : ... i believe that a reasonable case can be made for saying , not that we believe in god because he exists but rather that he exists because we believe in him ... considered as an element of the world , god has the same degree and kind of objective reality as do other products of mind ... i regret my disbelief in god and religious answers generally , for i believe it would give satisfaction and comfort to many in need of it if it were possible to discover and propound good scientific and philosophic reasons to believe in god ... to abdicate from the rule of reason and substitute for it an authentication of belief by the intentness and degree of conviction with which we hold it can be perilous and destructive ... i am a rationalist—something of a period piece nowadays , i admit ... although he normally sympathised with christianity especially on moral teachings , he found the biblical stories unethical and was `` shocked by the way in which [ biblical ] characters deceived and defrauded each other . '' he even asked his wife `` to make sure that such a book did not fall into the hands of [ their ] children . '' nonetheless , he also said the following , which suggests that although religion has good value for humans in aggregate , it does not help them all equally : religion has not sustained me on any of the occasions when the comfort it professes would have been most welcome . == later life and death == in <year> medawar was invited by the bbc to present the broadcaster 's annual reith lectures—following in the footsteps of his colleague , j . z . young , who was reith lecturer in <year> . for his own series of six radio broadcasts , titled the future of man , medawar examined how the human race might continue to evolve . while attending the annual british association meeting in <year> , medawar suffered a stroke when reading the lesson at exeter cathedral , a duty which falls on every new president of the british association . it was , as he said , `` monstrous bad luck because jim whyte black had not yet devised beta-blockers , which slow the heart-beat and could have preserved my health and my career '' . medawar 's failing health may have had repercussions for medical science and the relations between the scientific community and government . before the stroke , medawar was one of britain 's most influential scientists , especially in the biomedical field . after the impairment of his speech and movement , medawar , with his wife 's help , reorganised his life and continued to write and do research though on a greatly restricted scale . however , more haemorrhages followed and in <year> he died in the royal free hospital , london . he is interred with his wife jean ( 1913–2005 ) in the graveyard of st andrew 's church in alfriston in east sussex . == awards and honours == medawar was elected a fellow of the royal society ( frs ) in <year> . with

prize `` for the contribution his books had made in presenting to the public , and to scientists themselves , the intellectual nature and the essential humanity of pursuing science at the highest level and the part it played in our modern culture '' .medawar has three awards named after him : the royal society created the medawar lecture in <year> in a subject relating to the history of science , philosophy of science or the social function of science . since <year> , the lecture has been merged with two older ones honouring john wilkins and john desmond bernal , and became wilkins-bernal-medawar lecture and the accompanying award , wilkins-bernal-medawar medal . medawar medal , awarded by the british transplant society in recognition of significant research in organ transplantation . peter brian medawar medal , awarded by the state medical academy of rio de janeiro.the university of oxford has established a research consortium named the peter medawar building for pathogen research.the department of science and technology studies of the university college london has sts peter medawar prize for undergraduate students.the university of birmingham public engagement with research ( per ) team established an annual light of understanding award to individuals and groups who accomplished public engagement with research work . == publications == medawar was recognised as a brilliant author . richard dawkins called him `` the wittiest of all scientific writers '' , and new scientist magazine 's obituary called him `` perhaps the best science writer of his generation '' .one of his best-known essays is his <year> criticism of pierre teilhard de chardin 's the phenomenon of man , of which he said : `` its author can be excused of dishonesty only on the grounds that before deceiving others he has taken great pains to deceive himself '' .his books include , apart from his books on science and philosophy , he wrote a short feature article on `` some meistersinger records '' in the issue of the gramophone for november <year> . the author was a p. b. medawar . the evidence that this was indeed the future sir peter medawar—then a schoolboy of

student dr donald michie on <integer> october <year> . == early career and married life == as a couple , mclaren and donald michie worked together at university college london from <year> to <year> , and afterwards at the royal veterinary college , on the variation in the number of lumbar vertebrae in mice as a function of maternal environment . mclaren would later take up research on fertility in mice , including superovulation and superpregnancy . in <year> , she published a landmark nature paper with john d. biggers reporting the first successful development and birth of mice embryos that were first recovered from naturally fertilized females at the 8–16 cells stage , then cultured in vitro for two days until the blastocyst stage , and finally transferred back to females ' uterus until birth . this paper entitled `` successful development and birth of mice cultivated in vitro as early embryos '' has been called `` one of the most significant papers in the history of reproductive biology and medicine '' .during this period , she also had three children : susan michie ( born <integer> june <year> ) jonathan michie ( born <integer> march <year> ) caroline michie ( born in <year> ) however , the marriage ended in divorce in <year> , and mclaren moved to the institute of animal genetics in edinburgh to continue her research . the couple remained on good terms ; michie also moved to edinburgh . the experience of raising children as a single career parent made mclaren a strong advocate for government assistance towards childcare . == later career == mclaren spent the next <integer> years ( 1959–1974 ) at the institute of animal genetics , studying a variety of topics related to fertility , development and epigenetics , including the development of mouse embryonic

biography == stein was born on august <days> , <year> , in detroit , michigan , and his family moved to new york during the great depression . he enrolled in williams college just before he turned <integer> . after graduating with phi beta kappa honors , he went to washington , dc , to work as an economist in various agencies . he received his doctorate of philosophy in economics from the

of the lawyer , author , and actor ben stein and the writer rachel stein . herbert stein was also the original writer for the advice column dear prudence . == views == stein was known as a pragmatic conservative and was referred to as `` a liberal 's conservative and a conservative 's liberal . '' he was the author of the fiscal revolution in america . in one article , stein wrote that the people who wore an `` adam smith necktie '' did so to make a statement of their devotion to the idea of free markets and limited government . what stands out in [ smith 's seminal work ] wealth of nations , however , is that their patron saint was not pure or doctrinaire about this idea . he viewed government intervention in the market with great skepticism . he regarded his exposition of the virtues of the free market as his main contribution to policy , and the purpose for which his economic analysis was developed . yet he was prepared to accept or propose qualifications to that policy in the specific cases where he judged that their net effect would be beneficial and would not undermine the basically free character of the system . in stein 's reading , the wealth of nations could justify the food and drug administration , the consumer product safety commission , mandatory employer health benefits , environmentalism , and `` discriminatory taxation to deter improper or luxurious behavior . '' === stein 's law === stein propounded stein 's law , which he expressed in <year> as `` if something can not go on forever , it will stop . '' stein observed this logic in analyzing economic trends ( such as rising us federal debt in proportion to gdp , or increasing international balance of payments deficits , in his analysis ) : if such a process is limited by external factors , there is no urgency for government intervention to stop it , much less to make it stop immediately , but it will stop of its own accord . a paraphrase , not attributed to stein , is `` trends that ca n't continue wo n't .

archives of the zbw frank joseph malina ( october <days> , <year> — november <days> , <year> ) was an american aeronautical engineer and painter , especially known for becoming both a pioneer in the art world and the realm of scientific engineering . == early life == malina was born in brenham , texas . his father came from bohemia . frank 's formal education began with a degree in mechanical engineering from texas a & m university in <year> . the same year he received a scholarship to study mechanical engineering at the california institute of technology ( caltech ) , where he obtained his doctor degree in <year> . in <year> , while a graduate student at caltech , malina persuaded professor of aeronautics theodore von kármán to allow him to pursue studies into rocketry and rocket propulsion . the formal goal was development of a sounding rocket . malina and five associates ( including jack parsons and hsue-shen tsien ) became known at caltech as the `` suicide squad '' because of their dangerous experiments ( and failures ) when testing rocket motor designs . malina 's group was forced to move their operations away from the main caltech campus into the more remote arroyo seco . this site and the research malina was conducting would later become the jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) . malina served as the second director of jpl.in <year> , the société astronomique de france ( french astronomical society ) awarded malina the prix d'astronautique for his contribution to the study of interplanetary travel and astronautics . == career == in <year> , von kármán , malina and three other students started the aerojet corporation.by late <year> , malina 's rockets had outgrown the facility at arroyo seco , and his tests were moved to white sands missile range in new mexico . here , the project 's wac corporal sounding rocket was the first u.s. rocket to break the <other> altitude mark , becoming the first sounding rocket to reach space.during <year> , with rocket research in high gear , malina 's demanding travel and administrative schedule , along with a dislike of so much rocketry research being devoted to weapons systems and not scientific research , caused him to re-evaluate his career and leave aerojet . malina 's interest in the communist party , caltech 's `` unit <integer> , '' and labor activism while he was a graduate student in the 1930s had also attracted the attention of the fbi . however , there is `` scant evidence '' that unit <integer> or its `` communist offshoot '' ever passed rocket information to the soviet union in the 1930s or 1940s . ( `` the surveillance of suspected 'communists ' hardly ever revealed espionage and served mainly to feed prejudice . `` ) he moved to france and joined the fledgling united nations as secretariat of the united nations educational , scientific and cultural organization ( unesco ) under julian huxley . in <year> , malina became head of unesco 's division of scientific research . two years later , malina left unesco to pursue an interest in kinetic art . in <year> , at the height of the red scare , malina was indicted for having failed to list his communist party membership on an old security questionnaire from caltech . he was declared a fugitive , to be arrested if and when he returned to the united states.in <year> in paris he founded leonardo , an international peer-reviewed research journal that featured articles written by artists on their own work , and focused on the interactions between the contemporary arts with the sciences and new technologies . the leonardo journal is still published as of <year> as a project of leonardo/isast , the international society for the arts , sciences and technology.in <year> , malina was inducted into the international space hall of fame . == death and family == malina married twice . in <year> , he married liljan darcourt , a daughter of french catholic immigrants ; they divorced in <year> ( she later married advertising executive lester wunderman ) . frank malina died in <year> in boulogne-billancourt , near paris , france . his widow marjorie duckworth malina died in <year> . their sons roger and alan malina live and work in the dallas , tx area and portugal , respectively . == literature == fraser macdonald : escape from earth : a secret history of the space race . publicaffairs , new york , <year> , isbn <days> == see also == guggenheim aeronautical laboratory qian xuesen ( h.s . tsien ) == references and notes == == external links == `` malina , frank joseph '' . american national biography .

development economist best known for the singer–prebisch thesis , which states that the terms of trade move against producers of primary products . he is one of the primary figures of heterodox economics . == early life == he was born in elberfeld , germany , on <integer> november <year> . a german jew , singer had intended to become a medical doctor before he was inspired to study economics after attending a series of lectures by prominent economists joseph schumpeter and arthur spiethoff in bonn . singer fled the rise of adolf hitler in <year> , arriving in the united kingdom as a refugee . == career == in <year> , schumpeter convinced john maynard keynes of cambridge university to accept singer as one of his first phd candidates , and singer received his doctorate in <year> . his first academic post was in manchester where he stayed from <year> until <year> . under keynes , he produced two papers in <year> and <year> studying unemployment . keynes had also helped secure singer 's speedy release after his former student was interned by the british government at the start of the second world war . in <year> , singer applied for british citizenship , listing as references keynes , william beveridge , william temple , and the vice-chancellor of manchester university . his request was granted in <year> . in <year> , he was one of the first three economists to join the new economics department of the united nations ( un ) , in which he remained for the next two decades . during his time at the united nations , singer was the director of the economic division of the united nations industrial development organization ( unido ) , director of the united nations research institute for social development ( unrisd ) , and was closely involved in the creation of the bretton woods framework and the post–world war ii international financial institutions . he published a <year> empirical study examining the costs of international trade , drawing criticism from fellow economists jacob viner and gottfried haberler . this led to his famous co-credit with raul prebisch for the singer–prebisch thesis . however , the two economists had not collaborated but had come to similar conclusions separately . singer 's supporters are quick to point out that it appears that singer wrote down the thesis before the more well-known prebisch . the fundamental claim of the hypothesis is that in a world system in which poorer nations specialise in primary products such as raw minerals and agricultural products that are then shipped to industrialised nations that , in turn , make advanced products to be sold to poorer nations , all of the benefits of international trade go to the wealthy nations . as a result , singer was a passionate advocate for increased foreign aid in a variety of forms to the developing world to offset the disproportionate gain to developed nations of trade . he attempted to create a `` soft-loan '' fund to offer loans at interest rates below market rates to be administered by the united nations , but it was systematically blocked by the united states and the united kingdom , which wished to retain control of money flowing out of the un . he was thus considered `` one of the wild men of the un '' by eugene r. black sr. of the world bank and american senator eugene mccarthy . his ideas were influential in the establishment of the bank 's international development association , the united nations development programme , and the world food programme.fellow economist sir alec cairncross has said of singer , `` there are few of the developing countries that he has not visited and still fewer that he has not advised . he must have addressed a wider variety of academics and a wider variety of places about a wider variety of subjects than any other economist , living or dead . '' singer , like prebisch , was influential on neo-marxist development theorists such as paul baran and andre gunder frank . however , he was not normally considered a neo-marxist himself and did not consider himself one . == later life == in <year> , he left the un to join the influential institute of development studies ( ids ) at the university of sussex in england . he produced about <integer> books under his name and nearly <integer> other publications . the international institute of social studies ( iss ) awarded its honorary fellowship to hans singer in <year> . singer was knighted by queen elizabeth ii in <year> . in <year> the un world food programme awarded him the food for life award in recognition of his contribution to the battle against world hunger . [ <integer> ] <days> november <year> , singer was awarded the first lifetime achievement award from the development studies association . [ <integer> ] singer died in brighton on <integer> february <year> . == legacy == in commemoration and in honour of sir hans singer the german development institute and the institute of development studies initiated the hans singer memorial lecture on global development , which alternates between bonn and brighton on an annual basis . the first memorial lecture was given by the renowned development economist paul collier of the university of oxford <days> may <year> in bonn . the second lecture was held <days> october <year> in brighton with jomo kwame sundaram , assistant secretary

harvard , where she helped improve the accuracy of visual rangefinders used during world war ii . jameson continued to study vision at harvard in <year> . at that time ralph evans , then head of the color control division at eastman kodak , recognized that understanding color—both in the <other> world and in photographs—depends crucially on understanding perceptual processes and so recruited researches to work on visual perception.in <year> , jameson together with her husband hurvich provided quantitative data for hering 's opponent process color theory . it was called the `` hue cancellation method '' . hue cancellation experiments start with a color ( e.g . yellow ) and attempt to determine how much of the opponent color ( e.g . blue ) of one of the starting color 's components must be added to eliminate any hint of that component from the starting color.in <year> jameson won the edgar d. tillyer award from the optical society for her contributions to our

artist dorothy smith , who would later become his wife . after the war marjolin became the first director of the foreign trade department in the french ministry of economic affairs and then junior minister for the reconstruction of france . in this role he initiated the economic development of france for the following decades . in contrast with ludwig erhard of germany , marjolin implemented a strong state control of the economy . this contrast defined the relationship between the french and german economic policies for the remainder of the 20th century . == the marshall plan and the oeec == due to his ministerial responsibilities , marjolin was particularly involved with the marshall plan for assistance to europe . <days> august <year> he published a memorandum which helped persuade the united states congress to support the plan . in <year> marjolin was appointed the first secretary-general of the organisation for european economic co-operation ( oeec ) which was established to implement the marshall plan . particularly in the last years of his involvement , he tried to divert the organization from its course as a purely technical authority for the administration of the european trade relations . he wanted it to become politically active , in order to achieve both an economic and also an increasing political integration of european countries . towards the end of <year> marjolin surprisingly resigned from his oeec position stating that he wished to become `` an international civil servant '' . for a short time he was a member of the staff of the socialist minister of foreign affaires christian pineau and an economics professor at the university of nancy . == inaugural european commission member == in <year> he led the french delegation in negotiations on the formation of the european economic community ( eec ) . he attached particular importance to setting a common economic policy , a financial and monetary policy and as a result got the support of the german delegation leader alfred mueller armack as well as its deputy hans von der groeben . in <year> he was appointed one of the two french european commissioners on the first european commission , the hallstein commission with responsibility for the economics and finance portfolios . <days> january <year> he was re-appointed to the second hallstein commission . marjolin unsuccessfully stood as a candidate for the french socialists in the french parliamentary election <days> november <year> . a victory would have meant his leaving the commission but instead he served his full term which

robert marjolin in the 20th century press archives of the zbw suerf marjolin prize james michael cronin , mbe ( <integer> november <year> – <integer> march <year> ) was the american co-founder in <year> of monkey world in dorset , england , a sanctuary for abused and neglected primates . he was widely acknowledged as an international expert in the rescue and rehabilitation of abused primates , and in the enforcement of international treaties aimed at protecting them from illegal trade and experimentation . cronin was awarded an honorary mbe by queen elizabeth ii in <year> for services to animal welfare . == early life == cronin was born in yonkers , new york , to italian-irish parents . the son of a union official , he was educated at st denis school and lincoln high school . he had a number of jobs after leaving school before becoming a keeper at bronx zoo in the 1970s . while working there he realised he wanted to work with animals . in <year> he moved to kent in the uk to work in john aspinall 's zoo . == working with primates == cronin started his work with primates through working as a zoo keeper in various zoos . in <year> he came to britain where he acquired a job as a zoo keeper at john aspinall 's zoo at howletts , where he perfected his skills of primate rehabilitation and care . john aspinall had set up a breeding programme for gorillas which were an endangered species . cronin 's passion for working with primates made him quite successful in his career and encouraged him to have an ambition of one day building a safe haven for mistreated primates . during his years working at john aspinall 's zoo , he gave himself the necessary experience of dealing with apes on a daily basis in his career path of working with them as well as small monkeys and their complex life necessities . == monkey world == it was during cronin 's years working as a zoo keeper at the howletts zoo that he was notified about the plight of chimps being abused . these african great apes were being smuggled from the wild by illegal poachers and being transported abroad to europe , where the young chimpanzees were being purchased then used as photographic props by photographers on beach resorts in spain . these chimps would suffer horrible abuse – having their teeth knocked out to prevent them biting tourists , drugged to remain sedate , and physically beaten to remain submissive and easy to handle before growing too big and being killed to be simply replaced by another . cronin was infuriated by the fate that these magnificent apes encountered and decided to dedicate his life in trying to solve the problem . in the middle 1980s spain had released legislation that forbade the use of chimpanzees as photographer 's props , and this turn of action gave cronin some optimism on how he would reach his goal of helping the chimps . in <year> cronin approached a british couple called simon and peggy templer who had started rescuing the beach chimps in <year> . cronin worked together with the templers who had set up a half-way house where the confiscated chimps were being housed . the chimps would not be able to stay there for long , and it was cronin 's idea that shed light . cronin requested discussions on how he could possibly help and with the assistance of the spanish authorities ( the guardia civil ) confiscating the chimps , there would certainly be more individuals arriving at the small half-way house . during <year> cronin returned to england and focused on how he could possibly build a sanctuary for the chimps . the templers agreed to re-home the chimps at the sanctuary which cronin promised to be able to build . cronin recruited help from his best friend jeremy keeling , who was a fellow zoo keeper , and the pair set out to achieve their ambition of a primate sanctuary . cronin was notified about an abandoned pig farm located near wool , dorset . the old land covered <integer> acres and would be perfect for what would become a primate rescue centre . after securing a small business loan , cronin acquired permission to build the first enclosure which would be for the chimps . he knew that the animals needed to know how to live a natural way of life again , therefore cronin set up a map of the enclosure which would cover two acres , filled with grass , shrubs and custom-built climbing structures made from telephone poles . the whole two acres would be surrounded by an electric fence . after some finishing touches , such as human resources like a café and a children 's playground , the sanctuary was finally complete and was named monkey world ape rescue centre . <days> july <year> , cronin was able to bring the first group of nine chimps from the templers ' half-way house to monkey world . once at the park , the chimpanzees were rehabilitated and housed in their new accommodations . also within the park was one hand-reared female bornean orang-utan named amy , who was brought by jeremy keeling , whose job it was to look after the animals at the centre . there was the arrival of some barbary macaques , pig-tailed macaques and some ring-tailed lemurs , which made up the rest of the collection of primates housed in cronin 's rescue centre . more chimpanzees from spain arrived at the park . cronin opened monkey world on <integer> august <year> , providing the public with a rare opportunity to observe exotic primates . he made the sanctuary a rescue centre and not a zoo . the female chimpanzees were put on birth control to save space for more individuals needing rescuing . monkey world did not only rescue spanish beach chimps , but chimps from a variety of circumstances such as exotic pets , circus entertainers and medical research laboratory subjects . in <year> , cronin met alison ames , an authority on animal behaviour and cambridge graduate in biological anthropology . she and cronin were married in <year> , from then on running monkey world as a combined venture . cronin could hardly believe that his small refuge centre had grown into a thriving rescue centre for primates from around the world . monkey world worked with the ping tung rescue centre in taiwan in stopping the illegal smuggling of apes from the wild , and monkey world was able to re-home some of the primates from the ping tung rescue centre , including bornean orang-utans and different species of gibbon . monkey world started working with foreign governments in the prevention of primate smuggling for pet trades , including the pet trade in britain which allowed citizens to keep exotic small monkeys without being able to care for them properly or meet their substantial needs . cronin and alison travelled to places around the world , investigating animal trades , especially the trade and exploitation of primates . cronin 's sanctuary had successfully recruited a number of primate care staff who see that the day-to-day requirements of the primates are met . veterinary consultants were brought in to help treat the animals and adoption schemes were set up to allow the park to continue its rescue and rehabilitation work . the biggest rescue the centre undertook was that of the <integer> retired stump-tailed macaques from a medical research laboratory in the uk ; but the rescue mission in <year> , of the <integer> capuchin monkeys from a medical research laboratory in chile , took the record of the largest rescue of primates in the world . in <year> , cronin was awarded an mbe by queen elizabeth ii for services to animal welfare he was accompanied by robert pitts . cronin has also received the jane goodall award . the television series monkey business ( made by meridian broadcasting and shown on itv meridian in the uk and on animal planet worldwide ) has documented the cronin 's frequent rescue missions and undercover investigations throughout europe and asia for the past <integer> years . beginning in <year> , monkey business was replaced with monkey life , which also documents the goings-on within monkey world . == death == following a brief battle with liver cancer , cronin died on <integer> march <year> at the cabrini medical center , manhattan , new york . he was survived by his daughter eleanor , from his first marriage , and his wife alison cronin . since his death , monkey world has been run by alison . === jim

<year> . he also held the positions of foreign minister and ambassador to the united states . == biographic data == turbay was born in a rich neighborhood of “ voto nacional ” , bogotá , on june <days> , <year> . his father , antonio amín turbay , was a businessman who emigrated from tannourine , lebanon . his mother , rosaura ayala , was a peasant from the province of cundinamarca . turbay ’ s father , a hard working merchant , had built a fortune , which he completely lost during the civil war of the thousand days war . turbay ayala completed his secondary studies in bogotá , but never attended college , and instead became an autodidact , a fact that his political adversaries always poked fun at . he received a number of honorary degrees later in life . == political career == turbay started his political career in the liberal party as a councilman in the ( then ) town of usme in <year> . he would later be appointed as major of the city of girardot ( <year> ) , and then councilman in the town of engativá in <year> along with fellow politicians alfonso lópez michelsen and álvaro gómez hurtado . the next few years he spent as a member of the assembly of cundinamarca . in <year> he was chosen for congress as a chamber representative . he was a leader of the opposition to conservative governments , and in <year> became a member of the national directive of the liberal party . with the rise to power of the military junta that ousted dictator gustavo rojas pinilla , turbay was appointed minister of mines and petroleum . he was later appointed minister of foreign affairs by president alberto lleras camargo until <year> . he was known as a strong defender of the national front , and was chosen as senator for four consecutive periods between <year> and <year> . he also served briefly as interim president in <year> . he was also appointed as ambassador the un ( <other> ) , united kingdom ( <other> ) , and the united states ( <other> ) . he first attempted to become a presidential candidate in <year> , but ended up supporting lópez michelsen , who won the elections that year . the sector supporting lópez michelsen was instrumental in turbay 's presidential campaign of <year> , and after a very narrow election he became president of colombia in <year> . == presidency == === <year> security statute === in response to an increase in guerrilla activity from the 19th <days> april movement ( <other> ) and the revolutionary armed forces of colombia , as well as to the colombian communist party 's attempts to extend its political influence and a <year> national strike , a <year> decree , known as the security statute , was implemented by turbay 's administration . the security statute gave the military an increased degree of freedom of action , especially in urban areas , to detain , interrogate and eventually judge suspected guerrillas or their collaborators before military tribunals . human rights organizations , newspaper columnists , political personalities and opposition groups complained about an increase in the number of arbitrary detentions and acts of torture as a result . although the security statute allegedly benefited some of the counterinsurgency operations of the security forces , such as the capture of most of the <other> 's command structure and many of the guerrilla group 's urban cells , the measure became highly unpopular inside and outside colombia , promoting some measure of public sympathy for the victims of the real or perceived military abuses whether they were guerrillas or not , and was phased out towards the end of the turbay administration . === <year> dominican embassy crisis === the <other> 's late <year> takeover of the dominican republic 's embassy , during which sixteen ambassadors were held hostage for <integer> days , presented a complicated challenge to the turbay administration.the incident soon spread throughout worldwide headlines , as ambassadors from the united states of america , costa rica , mexico , peru , israel and venezuela had been taken hostage , as well as colombia 's top representative to the holy see . turbay , despite pressure from military and political sectors , avoided deciding to solve the crisis through the use of direct military force , and instead eventually agreed to let the <other> rebels travel to cuba . allegedly , the rebels also received usd <integer> million as payment , instead of the initial $ <integer> million that they had originally demanded from the government . that a mostly peaceful resolution to the crisis was found has been generally considered as a positive aspect of turbay 's administration , as seen by later and contemporary commentators and historians . in particular , former <other> members , including rosemberg pabón , the commander of the guerrilla group 's operative unit at the time , later recognized and respected turbay 's handling of the situation . == post-presidency == turbay was a supporter of president álvaro uribe . he initially opposed the possibility of presidential reelection in colombia , but later changed his views , contributing to founding a movement known as patria nueva ( `` new homeland '' ) , in order to help promote uribe 's <year> reelection aspirations . === support for a prisoner exchange with the farc === turbay was seen as being at odds with some of uribe 's policies , however , in particular due to turbay 's activism in favor of the implementation and negotiation of a prisoner exchange with the farc guerrilla group . as part of this effort , turbay participated in several meetings with the relatives of farc hostages and signed several declarations of support , together with other former presidents such as alfonso lópez michelsen and ernesto samper pizano . on august <days> , <year> , turbay proposed that the government could exchange each jailed guerrilla for <integer> `` economic '' hostages ( those held for extortion purposes ) and one `` political '' hostage ( those held by the farc in order to pressure the colombian government to release its jailed members ) . == personal life == turbay married his niece , nydia quintero turbay , on july <days> , <year> . they had four children together : julio césar , diana , claudia , and maría victoria . however , their marriage was annulled by the roman catholic church , and in <year> he married his longtime companion amparo canal , to whom he remained married until his death . he is related to paola turbay.in january <year> , turbay 's daughter , the journalist diana turbay , was kidnapped by orders of the medellín cartel and died during a failed police rescue operation not sanctioned by her family . her kidnapping is chronicled in news of a kidnapping by the nobel prize-winning author gabriel garcía márquez ( <year> ) and depicted in multiple onscreen productions . a personal idiosyncrasy of turbay 's was his custom of wearing bow ties , a sartorial habit extremely uncommon in colombia . == death == turbay died on <integer> september <year> , at the age of <integer> . he was honored by a state funeral personally led by president álvaro uribe and was buried at the sacromonte caves at canton norte , an army base in bogotá .. he visited lebanon with his family in <year> as a final trip to the homeland of his family . == references == == external links == julio césar turbay ayala at find a grave donald redfield griffin ( august <days> , <year> – november <days> , <year> ) was an american professor of zoology at various universities who conducted seminal research in animal behavior , animal navigation , acoustic orientation and sensory biophysics . in <year> , while an undergraduate at harvard university , he began studying the navigational method of bats , which he identified as animal echolocation in <year> . in the question of animal awareness ( <year> ) , he argued that animals are conscious like humans . griffin was the originator of the concept of mentophobia : the denial of the consciousness of other animals by scientists . == biography == griffin was born on august <days> , <year> in southampton , new york and attended harvard university , where he was awarded bachelor 's , master 's and doctoral degrees . after serving on the faculty of cornell university he became a professor at his alma mater and later worked at rockefeller university.while at harvard in the late 1930s , griffin worked with robert galambos on studies of animal echolocation . griffin conducted preliminary tests during the summer of <year> when he was a research fellow at the edmund niles huyck preserve and biological research station in rensselaerville , new york . he set up a minimal bat flight facility in a <other> square-foot room in a barn and then measured the ability of bats to avoid obstacles by having them fly through a barrier of metal wires suspended from a ceiling.the remaining work was done at harvard 's physical laboratories . using sound capture technology that had been developed by physicist g. w. pierce , galambos and pierce were able to determine that bats generate and hear sounds an octave higher than can be heard by humans and other animals . experiments they conducted used methods developed by hallowell davis to monitor the brains of bats and their hearing responses as they navigated their way past wires suspended from a laboratory ceiling . they showed how bats used echolocation to accurately avoid obstacles , which they were unable to do if their mouths or ears were kept shut . griffin coined the term `` echolocation '' in <year> to describe the phenomenon , which many physiologists of the day could not believe was possible . during world war ii , griffin worked for national defense research committee where he supported the approval of the bat bomb.at a time when animal thinking was a topic deemed unfit for serious research , griffin became a pioneer in the field of cognitive ethology , starting research in <year> that studied how animals think . his observations of the sophisticated abilities of animals to gather food and interact with their environment and each other led him to conclude that animals were conscious , thinking beings , not the mere automatons that had been postulated . in its obituary , the new york times credited griffin as `` the only reason that animal thinking was given consideration at all '' . while critics argue that cognitive ethology is anthropomorphic and subjective , those in the field have studied the ways that animals form concepts and mental states based on their interactions with their environment , showing how animals base their actions and anticipate the responses of other sentient beings . he was elected a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences in <year> . in <year> he was awarded the daniel giraud elliot medal from the national academy of sciences.he was a member of the national academy of sciences.griffin was the director of the institute for research in animal behavior , in the 1960s , which was formed as a collaboration between rockefeller university and the new york zoological society ( now wildlife conservation society ) . in <year> following on from resarch on bats conducted at the new york zoological society 's field station in trinidad and tobago , he married jocelyn crane . a resident of lexington , massachusetts since his <year> departure from rockefeller university , griffin died at his home there at age <integer> on november <days> , <year> . he was survived

massachusetts to jewish parents sylvia and joel miller , a housewife and attorney . he attended harvard university as an undergraduate student . he worked during world war ii as an economist in the division of tax research of the treasury department , and received a ph.d. in economics from johns hopkins university , <year> . his first academic appointment after receiving his doctorate was visiting assistant lecturer at the london school of economics . === career === in <year> , at carnegie institute of technology ( now carnegie mellon university ) , he collaborated with his colleague franco modigliani on the paper the cost of capital , corporate finance and the theory of investment . this paper urged a fundamental objection to the traditional view of corporate finance , according to which a corporation can reduce its cost of capital by finding the right debt-to-equity ratio . according to the modigliani–miller theorem , on the other hand , there is no right ratio , so corporate managers should seek to minimize tax liability and maximize corporate net wealth , letting the debt ratio chips fall where they will . the way in which they arrived at this conclusion made use of the `` no arbitrage '' argument , i.e . the premise that any state of affairs that will allow traders of any market instrument to create a riskless money machine will almost immediately disappear . they set the pattern for many arguments based on that premise in subsequent years . miller wrote or co-authored eight books . he became a fellow of the econometric society in <year> and

may <year> to <integer> may <year> . == early life == carazo was born in cartago . before serving as president , he was the director of the central bank , general manager for recope ( costa rica 's nationalized oil refinery business ) and president of the legislative assembly of costa rica ( <other> ) .he married estrella zeledón lizano in san josé on april <days> , <year> . the couple had five children : rodrigo alberto , mario ernesto , jorge manuel , álvaro , and rolando martin . their son , rolando , was killed in a motorcycle accident in rohrmoser , costa rica , <days> december <year> . he was traveling alone on his motorcycle when he failed to negotiate a turn losing control and colliding with a tree . he was <integer> years old . == presidency == during and immediately following his term , carazo played a central role in the founding of the university for peace , a united nations-affiliated educational institution that offers graduate programs in peace and development studies . his government also concentrated on and promoted the country 's petrochemical industry and even began exploration and digging near the talamanca mountain ridge in search for petroleum . in the energy sector , his government inaugurated the hydroelectric plant in lake arenal . the carazo government also regulated the excavation of gold in the southern region of the country . on the international front , carazo had to deal mainly with the radical changes in the neighboring country of nicaragua , which had been under the control of the somoza dictatorship for decades , whose rule costa rica had always opposed . as the sandinista movement rose in the 1970s , nicaragua was faced with civil unrest and small armed clashes . costa rica 's government supported any power against somoza and so backed backing to the sandinista insurgents . many of the battles that took place in the nicaraguan region bordering costa rica spilled onto costa rican soil . carazo 's government warned somoza to stay on his side of the border several times . the government also began plans on creating a defense force to fight off any somoza attempt to attack costa rican territory . the attacks finally ended in <year> once the sandinistas took control of the country , and somoza was exiled . the government received a strong backlash from the public , and the opposition claimed that carazo had failed to protect costa rica 's sovereignty . further , carazo 's government allowed three us helicopters to touch down on national soil to facilitate somoza 's escape from nicaragua . that sent the president 's critics on a political bashing rampage , calling the matter a disrespect to national sovereignty . later , in <year> , the central american democratic community was formed in san josé with us backing . its aim was to isolate nicaragua from the rest of central america as long as they had a communist regime in power . another big move was in <year> , when carazo 's government broke off all diplomatic ties with fidel castro 's cuba . carazo 's government was plagued by economic instability and social unrest . during his presidency , there was a world economic recession . petroleum prices were at historic highs , and the value of costa rica 's main crop , coffee , was falling . against the advice of his minister of finance , hernán sáenz jiménez , and the international monetary fund ( imf ) , carazo instructed the central bank of costa rica to borrow heavily to maintain the value of the colón , the local currency , in the hope that an economic recovery was close at hand . that policy eventually became unsustainable , leading to a catastrophic sudden devaluation <days> september <year> . the heavy load of debt that the central bank acquired contributed to the highest rates of inflation that costa rica has endured ever since . after stepping down as president in <year> , carazo became a well-known critic of the imf and other global financial institutions . in his last years , he campaigned vigorously against the central american free trade agreement ( cafta ) . == later life == carazo played a leadership role in initiatives to improve relations between north korea and the west . he made several visits to pyongyang in the early 1990s . his efforts contributed to the opening of unofficial channels of communication between the united states and north korea . carazo was the founding chairman of university for peace and united world colleges costa rica . carazo died from heart failure and multi-organ failure at the hospital méxico in san josé on december <days> , <year> at the age of <integer> . he was survived by his wife , former first lady estrella zeledón lizano , and four of their five children : rodrigo alberto , mario ernesto , jorge

pioneering work on ecosystem ecology . he and his brother howard t. odum wrote the popular ecology textbook , fundamentals of ecology ( <year> ) . the odum school of ecology is named in his honor . == biography == son of the sociologist howard w. odum , and older brother of the ecologist howard t. odum , e.p . odum credited his father for imparting a holistic approach to exploring subjects . when contemplating where to conduct his advanced graduate work , he rejected both the university of michigan and cornell university , as he did not feel that this holism was embodied in their approach to their biology departments.instead , he chose the graduate department of zoology at the university of illinois , where he earned his doctorate degree . there odum was a student of victor shelford , whose efforts led to the establishment of the nature conservancy.after getting his ph.d. in <year> , odum was hired to be the first resident biologist at the edmund niles huyck preserve and biological research station , in rensselaerville , new york . the <other> preserve had been founded in <year> and its research station established in <year> . the preserve ’ s first summer research fellows , also selected in <year> , were edward c. raney and donald griffin . raney , who had just finished his ph.d. at cornell , studied green frogs and bullfrogs ; he went on to become a leading ichthyologist ( zoologist who studies fish ) . griffin , who was completing his ph.d. at harvard , did research on bat echolocation ( he later became famous for that work ) . == marriage and family == odum and martha ann huff , whom he had met as a student , married at her home in wilmette , illinois , on november <days> , <year> . she continued her work as an artist . odum was very proud of martha 's accomplishments as an artist . she often painted landscapes when traveling with her husband across the us and overseas . martha ann odum joined her husband in rensselaerville , where he continued to work at the huyck preserve . his research included studying chickadees and—more important for his future as an ecologist—inventorying the plants and preparing a habitat map . his purpose was to establish a basis for succession studies of the land so man could plan and manage ecosystems . he and martha had two sons , william eugene and daniel thomas odum . their son william died young , in his 40s , but had already made important contributions to science while a faculty member at the university of virginia . == academic career at university of georgia == <days> september <year> , odum took a job as an instructor of biology at the university of georgia ( athens , georgia ) . in the late 1940s , while serving on the university 's biology faculty committee , which was then drawing up a new curriculum , he concluded there was an urgent need to incorporate the subject of ecology , since he learned that his colleagues generally did not know what ecology ( in its own right ) might be . he founded the institute of ecology , later named for him . in <year> the institute of ecology , which odum founded at the university of georgia , was named as the odum school of ecology , the first stand-alone academic unit of a research university dedicated to ecology . odum also founded two field research stations as a faculty member at the university of georgia : the university of georgia marine institute and the savannah river ecology lab . == work == === ecosystems === in the 1940s and 1950s , `` ecology '' was not yet a field of study that had been defined as a separate discipline . even professional biologists seemed to odum to be generally under-educated about how the earth 's ecological systems interact with one another . odum brought forward the importance of ecology as a discipline that should be a fundamental dimension of the training of a biologist . odum adopted and developed further the term `` ecosystem '' . although sometimes said to have been coined by raymond lindeman in <year> , the term `` ecosystem '' first appeared in a <year> publication by the british ecologist , arthur tansley , and had in <year> been coined by tansley 's colleague , roy clapham . before odum , the ecology of specific organisms and environments had been studied on a more limited scale within individual sub-disciplines of biology . many scientists doubted that it could be studied on a large scale , or as a discipline in itself . odum wrote a textbook on ecology with his brother , howard thomas odum , a graduate student at yale . the odum brothers ' book ( first edition , <year> ) , fundamentals of ecology , was the only textbook in the field for about ten years . among other things , the odums explored how one natural system can interact with another . === environmentalism === while odum did wish to influence the knowledge base and thinking of fellow biologists and of college and university students , his historical role was not as a promoter of public environmentalism as we now know it . however , his dedication in his <year> book , ecology , expressed that his father had inspired him to `` seek more harmonious relationships between man and nature '' . by <year> , when the first earth day was organized , odum 's conception of the living earth as a global set of interlaced ecosystems became one of the key insights of the environmental movement that has since spread through the world . he was , however , an independent thinker who was at times , gently critical of the slogans and fashionable concepts of the environmentalist movement . === legacy === odum 's will stipulated that , after his death , his <integer> acres ( 110,000 m2 ) on the middle oconee river in athens , ga. would be sold and developed according to plans he laid out before his death . he would often show friends and colleagues hand sketched plans for his vision of this green community . plans included that over <integer> percent of the property would be protected greenspace and walking trails , managed by the oconee river land trust . profits from the sale of the land would go to the eugene and william odum ecology fund , after $ <integer> million is set aside for a professorial chair at uga in odum 's name . the land was sold to builder john willis homes who is honoring odum ’ s wishes at beech creek preserve.odum 's financial contributions were focused on

agricultural scientist . == biography == born in stratford , new zealand in <year> , kirton was raised in a farming family who ran sheep and dairy cows on a block of land in a small settlement called kohuratahi , approximately <integer> km north-east of stratford . he received his primary education at marco school and went on to stratford technical high school for his secondary schooling where he was taught by mr h c johnson , a teacher who influenced many promising agriculturalists including c p mcmeekan.kirton attended victoria university of wellington for his agricultural intermediate before transferring to massey university where he completed a bagrsc ( <year> ) and an magsc ( <year> ) . for his magsc he received first class honours in sheep and dairy husbandry . while studying at massey he received a number of prizes including the lord bledisloe prize , the george terry memorial scholarship , the senior scholarship in agriculture ( declined ) , a new zealand wool board scholarship and a shell oil company scholarship . he then spent some time on the massey staff working for the sheep husbandry department . he received a macmillan brown agriculture research scholarship and a fulbright travel grant which enabled him to enroll for phd studies at michigan state university . he studied under professor a m pearson and completed a doctorate in food science in <year> . before leaving the usa kirton was elected to membership of sigma xi , the phd honorary fraternity . upon his return from the united states in <year> kirton was employed by the ministry of agriculture and fisheries in the meat group at the ruakura animal research station . in <year> he was promoted to lead the meat group and remained in this position for over <integer> years until he retired in <year> . kirton drove the need for a research abattoir and then oversaw the planning and construction of ruakura research abattoir . the abattoir remains to this day a major facility for undertaking production and processing research directly aligned to the new zealand meat industry . kirton took an interest in animal welfare and chaired the ruakura animal ethics committee for <integer> years from 1988–1997 . he was at first met with opposition from parts of the industry but , as a result of his hard work , those attitudes soon faded . == achievements == kirton was recognised worldwide as an authority on the growth , development and meat quality of farm animals . his expertise was particularly focused on sheep and then goats . he also had secondary interests in cattle and rabbits . kirton 's research was mainly focused on the chemical and dissected composition of carcasses , and the role of genotype or environment in altering these compositions . this included studying the effectiveness of analysing carcass composition through the use of measures such as <other> , ultrasound and various carcass probes . kirton helped develop more quantitative and scientific methods to help the industry in identifying meat quality to assist the selection of superior breeding sires . kirton dispelled a number of myths that prevailed in the industry , showing that— meat from old ram lambs does not have a flavour odour problem the shape of a sheep carcass has little effect on meat yield or quality white veal production does not require the absence of light or iron goats are an excellent source of lean red meat.kirton 's leadership was influential in the number of farmers choosing to no longer castrate their rams or even remove the tails , so improving meat yield without compromising meat quality , and improving animal welfare . [ <integer> ] kirton produced over <integer> publications for the meat science scientific literature , <integer> of which he was senior author , and contributed <integer> chapters to a number of books at the forefront of the industry . he was a committee member , secretary-treasurer , vice-president , and an honorary life member of the new zealand society of animal production ( <year> ) , a committee member , vice-president , president ( 1969–70 , 1970–71 ) and ( 1991–92 , 1992–93 ) of the new zealand association of scientists , and a committee member and a president ( 1980–81 ) of the waikato section of the new zealand institute of agricultural science and a council member and president ( 1987–88 ) of the national body . == honours and awards == kirton was the recipient of a number of awards and honours for his work : fulbright travel grant – <year> research medal of new zealand association of scientists – <year> fellow of new zealand institute of agricultural science – <year> dsc from massey university for his work in the field of animal growth – <year> marsden medal of the new zealand association of scientists – <year> fellow of the royal society of new zealand – <year> member of the order of the british empire , for services to agricultural science , in the <year> queen 's birthday honours hutton medal by the royal society of new zealand for science and technological merit in animal sciences – <year> doug campbell award by the new zealand institute of agricultural science for services to the institute – <year> . == references == royal society of new zealand : alan henry kirton new zealandsociety of animal production : alan henry kirton ( nomination for life membership ) charles david keeling ( april <days> , <year> – june <days> , <year> ) was an american scientist whose recording of carbon dioxide at the mauna loa observatory confirmed svante arrhenius 's proposition ( <year> ) of the possibility of anthropogenic contribution to the `` greenhouse effect '' and global warming , by documenting the steadily rising carbon dioxide levels . the keeling curve measures the progressive buildup of carbon dioxide , a greenhouse gas , in the atmosphere . == early life and early career == keeling was born in scranton , pennsylvania , to ralph keeling and grace l keeling ( née sherberne ) . his father , an investment banker , excited interests of astronomy in a <other> charles , while his mother instilled a lifelong love of music . he graduated with a degree in chemistry from the university of illinois in <year> . charles keeling earned a phd in chemistry from northwestern university in <year> under malcolm dole , a polymer chemist . most of dole 's graduates were going straight into the oil industry ; keeling `` had trouble seeing the future this way '' and had become interested in geology , for which he had acquired most of the undergraduate coursework during his phd . keeling had applied for postdoctoral positions as a chemist almost exclusively to geology departments `` west of the continental divide . '' he received an offer from harrison brown who had recently started a geochemistry department at california institute of technology . he was a postdoctoral fellow in geochemistry there until he joined scripps institution of oceanography in <year> , and was appointed professor of oceanography there in 1968.at caltech he developed the first instrument able to measure carbon dioxide in atmospheric samples with consistently reliable accuracy . keeling camped at big sur where he used his new device to measure the level of carbon dioxide and found that it had risen since the 19th century . == work with scripps institution of oceanography , 1958–2005 == keeling worked at the scripps institution for <integer> years during which time he published many influential papers . roger revelle , the director of scripps institution of oceanography , based at la jolla , california , persuaded keeling to continue his work there . revelle was also one of the founders of the international geophysical year ( igy ) in 1957–58 and keeling received igy funding to establish a base on mauna loa in hawaii , two miles ( 3,000 m ) above sea level . keeling started collecting carbon dioxide samples at the base in <year> . by <year> , he had established that there are strong seasonal variations in carbon dioxide levels with peak levels reached in the late northern hemisphere winter . a reduction in carbon dioxide followed during spring and early summer each year as plant growth increased in the land-rich northern hemisphere . in <year> , keeling produced data showing that carbon dioxide levels were rising steadily in what later became known as the `` keeling curve '' . in the early 1960s , the national science foundation stopped supporting his research , calling the outcome `` routine '' . despite this lack of interest , the foundation used keeling 's research in its warning in <year> of rapidly increasing amounts of heat-trapping gases . a <year> report from president johnson 's science advisory committee similarly warned of the dangers of extra heat-trapping gases , which cause the temperature of the earth to rise . the data collection started by keeling and continued at mauna loa is the longest continuous record of atmospheric carbon dioxide in the world and is considered a reliable indicator of the global trend in the mid-level troposphere . keeling 's research showed that the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide grew from <integer> parts per million ( ppm ) in <year> to <integer> ( ppm ) in <year> , with increases correlated to fossil fuel emissions . there has also been an increase in seasonal variation in samples from the late 20th century and early 21st century . == personal life == keeling was an enthusiastic outdoorsman who made many hiking and camping trips to the western mountains , particularly the cascade mountains of washington state . he was an active member of the wilderness society for much of his life.keeling married louise barthold in <year> . they had five children , one of whom ( ralph keeling ) followed in his father 's footsteps and was a climate scientist at scripps institution of oceanography . charles keeling was also an accomplished classical pianist who almost chose a career in music . keeling was a founding director of the university of california san diego madrigal singers . he was also general chairman of the citizens committee which drafted the del mar general plan ( or `` community plan '' ) in 1975.keeling died in <year> , aged <integer> , of a heart attack . == legacy == at a white house ceremony held <days> july <year> , keeling was presented with a `` special achievement award '' from vice president al gore . keeling was honored `` for <integer> years of outstanding scientific research associated with monitoring of atmospheric carbon dioxide in connection with mauna loa observatory '' . the keeling curve is `` engraved in bronze on a building at mauna loa and carved into a wall at the national academy of sciences in washington . '' it was also a chart on the wall in a classroom at harvard university where dr. revelle had moved to teach in the 1960s and where among others , student al gore would see and `` marvel '' at it . in <year> , gore featured the graph in the book and movie an inconvenient truth and , together with the united nations ' intergovernmental panel on climate change , was awarded the <year> nobel peace prize . charles david keeling memorial lecture series , scripps institution of oceanography , since <year> . keeling lecture , university of illinois , since <year> . the charles david keeling apartments at revelle college of the university of california san diego , opened in <year> , were designed to emphasize environmental awareness and minimize ecological impact . dr keeling 's curve ( <year> ) , one-man play written by george shea and performed by mike farrell . the keeling curve prize . multiple awards presented annually by the global warming mitigation project since <year> . == memberships/fellowships == keeling was a guggenheim fellow at the meteorological institute , university of stockholm ( 1961–62 ) ; a guest professor at the second physical institute of the university of heidelberg ( 1969–70 ) and the physical institute of the university of bern ( 1979–80 ) . he was a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences , the american geophysical union , and the american association for the advancement of science , and a member of the national academy of sciences . he was a member of the commission on global pollution of the international association of meteorology , and scientific director of the central co2 calibration laboratory of the world meteorological organization . == selected publications == keeling , charles d.

causes . prior to the start of world war ii , he received his baccalauréat and went to ambert to begin preparing for the entrance examination of a grande école . later on , he moved from ambert to grenoble to complete his preparation , both places being in vichy france during world war ii . in <year> , he was admitted to the école normale supérieure in paris , along with marcel boiteux . he was influenced by henri cartan and the bourbaki writers . when he was about to take the final examinations in <year> , the normandy landings occurred and he , instead , enlisted in the french army . he was transferred for training to algeria and then served in the occupying french forces in germany until july <year> . debreu passed the agrégation de mathématiques exams at the end of <year> and the beginning of <year> . by this time , he had become interested in economics , particularly in the general equilibrium theory of léon walras . from <year> to <year> , he was an assistant in the centre national de la recherche scientifique . during these two and a half years , he made the transition from mathematics to economics . in <year> , debreu went to the united states on a rockefeller fellowship which allowed him to visit several american universities , as well as those in uppsala and oslo in 1949–50 . debreu married françoise bled in <year> and they had two daughters , chantal and florence , born in <year> and <year> respectively . debreu died in paris at the age of <integer> of natural causes on new year 's eve , <year> . == academic career == debreu began working as a research associate and joined the cowles commission at the university of chicago in the summer of <year> . he remained there for five years , returning to paris periodically . in <year> , he published a breakthrough paper , entitled existence of an equilibrium for a competitive economy , together with kenneth arrow , in which they provided a definitive mathematical proof of the existence of a general equilibrium , using topological rather than calculus-based methods . in <year> , he moved to yale university . in <year> , he published his classical monograph , theory of value : an axiomatic analysis of economic equilibrium ( cowles foundation monographs series ) , which is one of the most important works in mathematical economics . he also studied several problems in the theory of cardinal utility , in particular the additive decomposition of a utility function defined on a cartesian product of sets . in this monograph , debreu set up an axiomatic foundation for competitive markets . he also established the existence of an equilibrium using a novel approach . the main idea of his argument is to show that there exists a price system for which the aggregate excess demand correspondence vanishes . he did so by proving a type of fixed-point theorem that is based on the kakutani fixed-point theorem . in chapter <integer> , debreu introduced the concept of uncertainty and showed how it could be incorporated into the deterministic model . here , he introduced the notion of a contingent commodity , which is a promise to deliver a good should a certain state of nature be realized . this concept is very frequently used in financial economics , where it is known as the `` arrow–debreu security '' . in 1960–61 , he worked at the center for advanced study in the behavioral sciences at stanford and devoted most of his time to the complex proof that appeared in <year> of a general theorem on the existence of an economic equilibrium . <days> january <year> , he started working at the university of california , berkeley , where he held the titles of university professor and class of <year> professor of economics and mathematics emeritus . during his sabbaticals in the late 1960s and 1970s , he visited universities in leiden , cambridge , bonn and paris . in <year> , he visited the university of canterbury as an erskine fellow , lecturing in economic theory.his later studies centred mainly on the theory of differentiable economies , where he showed that , in general , aggregate excess demand functions vanish at a finite number of points – basically , he showed that economies have a finite number of price equilibria . in <year> , he received the french legion of honour . he was awarded the <year> bank of sweden prize in economic sciences in memory of alfred nobel , for having incorporated new analytical methods into economic theory and for his rigorous reformulation of general equilibrium theory . he was a member of the international academy of science . in <year> , he served as president of the american economic association . == major publications == === books === debreu , gérard ( <year> ) . the theory of value :

november <year> ) , was an indian development economist and educator . in <year> he was awarded the padma bhushan , india 's third highest civilian award . in <year> the unesco created 'the malcolm adiseshiah international literacy prize ' in recognition of his contribution to education and literacy . he was nominated to the rajya sabha , the upper house of the parliament of india in <year> . == early years and education == adiseshiah was born on <integer> april <year> in vellore , southern india . he is the second of the five children of paul varanasi adiseshiah and grace nesamma adiseshiah . his father was professor of philosophy and the first indian principal of voorhees college , vellore , tamil nadu state , india . his mother was a musician , who had studied up to the senior cambridge ( high school ) and was the first woman councilor of the vellore municipality . she taught her five children until they were ten years of age . malcolm adiseshiah obtained a doctorate in economics at the london school of economics , william , the eldest brother , in philosophy at cambridge , padmini in education and noble in medicine . adiseshiah studied in voorhees high school , where he obtained two double promotions . he completed his secondary school education at the age of thirteen to join voorhees college for his ‘ intermediate ’ course ( equivalent to +2 course now . ) then he shifted to loyola college , chennai for his ba ( honours ) , where ramaswamy venkataraman , the former president of india , was his classmate . after a six-year teaching interregnum at the st. paul 's cathedral mission college in calcutta ( now kolkata ) , he proceeded to king 's college , cambridge for his ma ( banking ) and then to the london school of economics ( 1937–40 ) for pursuing his doctoral research with specialization in currency . late dr. r. n. poduval , who served in fao and then was chairman of centre for research in economic and social development , chennai was two years his junior in lse . in later life , after his retirement from unesco , adiseshiah recalled his training and research ; under the wise guidance of father basneck and professor p.j . thomas in madras , benoy kumar and nalini ranjan sarkar in calcutta , percy barrat whale and john maynard keynes in london and cambridge1 . == teaching career == in <year> adiseshiah joined as a lecturer in st. paul 's cathedral mission college , an affiliate of the university of calcutta and continued until <year> . in the college he worked on planning a rural service programme in cooperation with the visva-bharati university associates at sriniketan and santiniketan . in <year> , after obtaining his doctorate at the age of thirty , he joined madras christian college , chennai , as its first professor and head of the economics department . his role and support for the british government in the notorious and deadly bengal famines of 1940s is a controversial topic . he remained in there until <year> . prof. k. n. raj , founder of centre for developmental studies , tiruvananthapuram , and g. jagathpathy , former chief secretary of the government of madhya pradesh were his students in the <other> batch of ba honours course . raj recalled this experience : in the villages of bengal and south india with their rural service centres where we worked out the economics of hand pound rice , hand-made paper , hand-loomed textiles , crop rotation and rural credit , rural medicine and sanitation , adult literacy and curriculum reform . it was there that i found the testing ground for the many ideas and plans that i carried with me to unesco in paris and from there to the four corners of the earth.5 his publications in 1940s included books on banking , rural development and agricultural transformation . he was engaged , with his fellow economists in the madras university , in work on planning the future industrialization of india and madras state . == personal life == adiseshiah married helen paranjothi , with whom he had a son and a daughter . the separation process with helen paranjothi started in <year> and the annulment of the marriage came in <year> . adiseshiah then married elizabeth pothen , a history professor who he met at the madras women ’ s christian college . == unesco and un service == from <other> adiseshiah served as associate general secretary of the world university service in geneva . this association helped him later to support steps for the construction of world university service centre in chennai and women ’ s hostels in delhi and rajasthan . during that period , he was also connected with the world student christian federation and student volunteer service . from <integer> to <integer> november <year> a united nations conference was convened in london for the establishment of an educational and cultural organization ( eco/conf ) . in the conference , a new organization was created to establish the “ intellectual and moral solidarity of mankind ” and thus prevent the outbreak of another world war . the united nations educational , scientific and cultural organization ( unesco ) was founded by thirty-seven countries . its constitution to promote collaboration between member states in the fields of education , science and culture was signed on <integer> november <year> and came into force on <integer> november <year> . sarvepalli radhakrishnan , former president of india , was a former student of adiseshiah ’ s father . he made a referral to sir julian huxley , then director-general of unesco , who invited adiseshiah to the organization in <year> . he was posted as deputy director of the department of exchange of persons . in that capacity adiseshiah signed the unesco fellowship letter in <year> to m. s. swaminathan , eminent scientist and administrator , to pursue research at the agricultural university in wageningen , the netherlands which was the starting point of his illustrious career . <days> march <year> adiseshiah was promoted to the post of director of technical assistance department , he was one of its six top executives . adiseshiah was authorized to represent the director-general at the technical assistance board set up by the un . rene ochs , a fellow member of staff , who later rose to be a director at unesco , wrote about this period : the stage was set for the beginning of a new era . everything was possible ; yet everything remained to be done with non-existent resources . it was done , though in a surprisingly short time , by very few people , among whom malcolm adiseshiah held a prominent , if not a unique place . those who had the privilege of working with him from the early years of technical assistance , and the following years of growing success and achievements , witnessed the outstanding performance of man whose extraordinary vision immediately recognized the opportunity offered , projected its potentialities into the future and made the dream come true . this required no less than the towering quality of his intelligence , his rare organizational ability and resourcefulness , his uncommon physical stamina , his unrelenting pace of work and unflinching dedication to the task at hand and a faith coupled with realism which carried mountains . <integer> unesco 's tentative proposals were submitted for technical assistance for economic development in <other> . adiseshiah organized the new department , established area desks corresponding to un geographical regions , instituted the procedures and methods of operation and set up a ‘ report and information unit ’ which produced periodically a technical assistance bulletin . in <year> , he was promoted as one among the three assistant directors general of unesco and put in charge of development . the third stage of unesco ’ s activities dated from the early sixties when many african countries became independent and joined it . in <year> , he was promoted to the post of deputy director general of unesco . then he was the sole incumbent to that office . the unesco began organizing important regional conferences of ministers of education or ministers of sciences along with ministries of economic development . the first asian ministers of education conference was held in karachi in <year> and the first conference for africa in addis ababa in <year> . in <year> , sylvain lourie , assistant director general of unesco , wrote : radical changes which had affected educational demand and supply are forcing a reconsideration of the very foundations of educational planning such as they prevailed in their heyday some <integer> years ago , when dr. adiseshiah played a historical role , guiding unesco in setting regional targets for public spending on education throughout the world and in establishing unesco international institute for educational planning.7 adiseshiah was responsible for the development of the karachi plan for universal primary education for asia , the addis ababa and santiago plans for the african and latin american educational development and the corresponding science plans for asia , africa and latin america . he worked with david owen , executive chairman of the technical assistance board to convince donor countries , since the financing of the expanded programme rested on voluntary contributions made by them at pledging conferences . in the need of additional sources he established relations with the international development association ( ida ) , inter-american development bank and other regional development banks . in <year> unesco approached the world bank , also known as international bank for reconstruction and development ( ibrd ) for medium trade credit for funding a project in tunisia . the ibrd until then was concentrating on investments in physical capital . adiseshiah contributed on the persuasion to shift ibrd ’ s focus exclusively from expansion of physical capital towards the development of human capital , especially extension of education . in <year> he participated in negotiating the memorandum of understanding between international bank for reconstruction and development and unesco . he introduced flexibility in utilizing multilateral aid . adiseshiah used a substantial part of ussr contribution for technical assistance for establishing iit , mumbai . the expanded technical assistance programme was merged with the united nations special fund to form the united nations development programme ( undp ) which was launched in <year> . he formulated in each country a programme of technical and financial assistance , which he started with a global outlay of $ <integer> million per annum in <year> . when he retired from the organization , the outlay had increased to $ <integer> million . adiseshiah said : unesco has had a double responsibility . first it has had to coordinate the entire educational programmes of the united nations family and give each part of the programme the expertise and help it needed . secondly , for the un system , it has had to act as the focal point and leader in all matters of education and science ... there has been a continuing process by unesco of clarifying , refining and consolidating its own educational and scientific mandate . ... education and science also have wider connotations in their application to peace and understanding ... ” <integer> adiseshiah kindled efficiency by arousing team spirit . he had mastered the art of training a team to fulfil the aspirations of the mission . he made two rounds of round the world trips each year which took him to as many as twenty five countries in succession . he organized more than <integer> projects in various countries for their economic and social development through education , science and culture . adiseshiah visited the hundred and twenty seven member states of the un several times . he visited each one of the third world countries that was becoming member of the unesco , studied its economic situation first hand , assessed its need for literacy and education and made recommendations as to how those needs could be met in the ‘ mission reports. ’ each of the ‘ mission reports ’ were reported to be pioneering contributions about the specific regions on which the reports focused to the emerging discipline of development economics . in <year> the then director-general , rene maheu , was reluctant to let him retire . adiseshiah insisted on leaving . rene maheu obtained the sanction of the executive board of unesco to replace adiseshiah with two deputy director-generals . there are in the unesco archives <integer> adiseshiah files covering approximately 48,000 pages . as unesco official , he rendered assistance to indian projects . the publication of unesco art album on ajantha was mainly due to his yeomen efforts and was due to his vision that the heritage sites of humankind must be preserved for all posterity . unesco assisted in the setting up of national council of educational research and training ( ncert ) , new delhi : the establishment of first tv broadcasts in india ; the reorganization of films division of india ; the provision of twenty renowned professors of engineering and science ; the supply of $ <integer> million worth of equipment to iits of bombay and kharagpur ; the expansion of aeronautical engineering in madras institute of technology ; and the provision of experts and equipment to alagappa chettiar college of engineering and technology in madras ( now chennai ) , tamil nadu . he was instrumental in rendering such assistance to all member nations of unesco with special emphasis to asian , african and south american nations . after his retirement from unesco , until <year> , he had visited countries of africa , latin america and asia at their invitation three times a year to advise them on their development plans . <days> january <year> , adiseshiah was elected chairman of the governing board of the unesco international institute for educational planning ( iiep ) for a five-year period . in <year> he was re-elected for a second term for five years . in <year> , <year> and <year> he was the chairman of the jury for the selection of the international literacy prize winners . in <year> he delivered the presidential address at the world literacy day function in paris . adiseshiah was a member of the un international committee of consultants on environment . he was the co-coordinator of the unesco working group on the new international economic order . he reviewed india ’ s experience with the un during the first forty years of its existence in an assessment of the role of the international bank of reconstruction and development ( ibrd ) and international monetary fund ( imf ) and the powerful interests working behind the scenes in shaping their policies in a book which he edited . == mids == <days> september <year> adiseshiah and his wife elizabeth registered in paris a trust fund for starting madras institute of development studies ( mids hereafter ) . mids was conceived to undertake studies and research on developmental issues on the economy , polity and society with special reference to tamil nadu state . mids started functioning from january <year> in one of their properties in gandhinagar , adyar , a chennai suburb . adiseshiah was its first director . adiseshiah started publishing the publishing of ‘ bulletin – madras development seminar series ’ <days> february <year> , and wrote its editorials every month from feb. <year> covering international , national and tamil nadu issues , until his death . ‘ this surely ’ wrote , prof.s . subramanian , in the prolegomena of the special issue of the bulletin bought out after his demise , ‘ is the stuff of which archives are made ’ <integer> as chairman , he evinced keen interest in all activities of the institute . the way he conducted the meetings of the governing council , the meticulous care with which he handled the agenda items , the intense attention he paid to every detail , the insistence that the minutes of the meetings should be made available to the members within three days and the concern he had to attract highly qualified faculty to the institute from all regions of india were all reflections of his exceptional caliber as an institution builder . at the same time , he never interfered in the day-to-day activities of the institute which were within the administrative province of the director . the faculty and staff had easy access to him . but they had to finish their business with him as quickly as possible since he would signal his craving to return to his unfinished work the very next moment after their business was heard or resolved ! as dr. barbara harris-white of idc , oxford university writes , it is more accurate to say that he enabled mids to be built . he created a place where motivated scholars could work at their projects with a minimum of direction or regulation . this kind of scholarly environment is now extremely rare anywhere in the world.11 in early 1990s he apprehended that the central and state governments might not fulfil their financial commitments to the institute to the fullest extent necessary . it made him sad . with his wide contacts , he , who had succeeded in finding resources for unesco ’ s huge technical assistance programme , could have easily raised additional resources for the institute had he solicited for it . but he was reluctant to ask . he who insisted that all departments of madras university should combine both teaching and research programmes failed to introduce a teaching programme in his own institute . nor was he successful in construction of accommodation for the doctoral scholars of his institute . == educationalist == his early teaching career , his vice chancellorship of the madras university and his various activities in his entire life had their focal point in education . a major part of his unesco service was spent in formulating educational programmes for the developing world . the general conference of unesco in its fifteenth session authorized the publication of a work designed to clarify the basic concepts concerning the contribution of education , science and culture to development . in the course of the discussions about the resolution , reference was made to the many speeches of adiseshiah on related themes delivered in oxford , united kingdom in <year> ; cambridge , uk and tananarive , madagascar in <year> ; madras , india in <year> ; toronto , ontario , canada in <year> ; washington , dc , usa in <year> and many others . he was requested to write a book based on the facts and ideas presented in those speeches about that book , u thant , then secretary-general of the united nations , in his ‘ foreword ’ writes : in his humanistic approach to the role of education , science and culture in the development process , dr. malcolm adiseshiah has reviewed the past in order to seek improvement in the future . the philosophy of development set forth in this volume is a bright beacon which

sperry as the 44th most cited psychologist of the 20th century . == early life and education == sperry was born in hartford , connecticut , to francis bushnell and florence kraemer sperry . his father was in banking , and his mother trained in business school . he was raised in an upper middle-class environment , which stressed academic achievement . roger had one brother , russell loomis . their father died when roger was <integer> . afterwards , his mother became assistant to the principal in the local high school . sperry went to hall high school in west hartford , connecticut , where he was a star athlete in several sports , and did well enough academically to win a scholarship to oberlin college . at oberlin , he was captain of the basketball team , and he also took part in varsity baseball , football , and track . he also worked at a cafe on campus to help support himself . sperry was an english major , but he took an intro to psychology class taught by a professor named r. h. stetson who had worked with william james , the father of american psychology . this class sparked sperry 's interest in the brain and how it can change . stetson was disabled and had trouble getting around so sperry would help him out by driving him to and from wherever he needed to go . this included taking stetson to lunch with his colleagues . sperry would just sit at the end of the table and listen to stetson and his colleagues discuss their research and other psychological interests . this increased sperry 's interest in psychology even more and after he received his undergraduate degree in english from oberlin he decided to stay and get his master 's degree in psychology . he received his bachelor 's degree in english in <year> and a master 's degree in psychology in <year> . he

university of chicago . in <year> , during a routine chest x-ray , there was evidence of tuberculosis . he was sent to saranac lake in the adironack mountains in new york for treatment . it was during this time when he began writing his concepts of the mind and brain , and was first published in the american scientist in <year> . in <year> , he became the section chief of neurological diseases and blindness at the national institutes of health and finished out the year at the marine biology laboratory in coral gables , fl . sperry went back to the university of chicago in <year> and became an associate professor of psychology . he was not offered tenure at chicago and planned to move to bethesda , maryland but was held up by a delay in construction at the national institutes of health . during this time sperry 's friend victor hepburn invited him to lecture about his research at a symposium . there were professors from the california institute of technology in the audience of the symposium who , after listening to sperry 's lecture , were so impressed with him they offered him a job as the hixson professor of psychobiology . in <year> , he accepted the position as a professor at the california institute of technology ( caltech as hixson professor of psychobiology ) where he performed his most famous experiments with joseph bogen , md and many students including michael gazzaniga . under the supervision of paul weiss while earning his ph.d. at the university of chicago , sperry became interested in neuronal specificity and brain circuitry and began questioning the existing concepts about these two topics . he asked the simple question first asked in his introduction to psychology class at oberlin : nature or nurture ? he began a series of experiments in an attempt to answer this question . sperry crosswired the motor nerves of rats ' legs so the left nerve controlled the right leg and vice versa . he would then place the rats in a cage that had an electric grid on the bottom separated into four sections . each leg of the rat was placed into one of the four sections of the electric grid . a shock was administered to a specific section of the grid , for example the grid where the rat 's left back leg was located would receive a shock . every time the left paw was shocked the rat would lift his right paw and vice versa . sperry wanted to know how long it would take the rat to realize he was lifting the wrong paw . after repeated tests sperry found that the rats never learned to lift up the correct paw , leading him to the conclusion that some things are just hardwired and can not be relearned . in sperry 's words , `` no adaptive functioning of the nervous system took place . '' during sperry 's postdoctoral years with karl lashley at harvard and at the yerkes laboratories of primate biology in orange park , florida , he continued his work on neuronal specificity that he had begun as a doctoral student and initiated a new series of studies involving salamanders . the optic nerves were sectioned and the eyes rotated <integer> degrees . the question was whether vision would be normal after regeneration or would the animal forever view the world as `` upside down '' and right-left reversed . should the latter prove to be the case , it would mean that the nerves were somehow `` guided '' back to their original sites of termination . restoration of normal vision ( i.e. , `` seeing '' the world in a `` right-side-up '' orientation ) would mean that the regenerating nerves had terminated in new sites , quite different from the original ones . the animals reacted as though the world was upside down and reversed from right to left . furthermore , no amount of training could change the response . these studies , which provided strong evidence for nerve guidance by `` intricate chemical codes under genetic control '' ( <year> ) culminated in sperry 's chemoaffinity hypothesis ( <year> ) .sperry later served on the board of trustees and as professor of psychobiology emeritus at california institute of technology . the sperry neuroscience building at oberlin college was named in his honor in <year> . == nobel prize == sperry was granted numerous awards over his lifetime , including the california scientist of the year award in <year> , the national medal of science in <year> , the wolf prize in medicine in <year> , and the albert lasker medical research award in <year> , and the nobel prize for medicine/physiology in <year> that he shared with david h. hubel and torsten n. wiesel . sperry won this award for his work with `` split-brain '' patients . the brain is divided into two hemispheres , the left and right hemispheres , connected in the middle by a part of the brain called the corpus callosum . in `` split-brain '' patients , the corpus callosum has been severed due to the patients suffering from epilepsy , a disease that causes intense and persistent seizures . seizures begin in one hemisphere and continue into the other hemisphere . cutting the corpus callosum prevents the seizures from moving from one hemisphere to the other , which then prevents seizures from occurring , thus allowing the patients to function normally instead of suffering from continuous seizures . sperry first became interested in `` split-brain '' research when he was working on the topic of interocular transfer , which occurs when `` one learns with one eye how to solve a problem then , with that eye covered and using the other eye , one already knows how to solve the problem '' . sperry asked the question : `` how can the learning with one eye appear with the use of the other ? '' sperry cut nerves in the eyes of cats so the left eye was connected to the left hemisphere and the right eye was connected to the right hemisphere ; he also cut the corpus callosum . the cats were then taught to distinguish a triangle from a square with the right eye covered . then the cats were presented the same problem with the left eye covered ; the cats had no idea what they had just learned with the right eye and because of this could be taught to distinguish a square from a triangle . depending on which eye was covered , the cats would either distinguish a square from a triangle or a triangle from a square , demonstrating that the left and right hemispheres learned and remembered two different events . this led sperry to believe that the left and right hemispheres function separately when not connected by the corpus callosum . sperry 's research with `` split-brain '' cats helped lead to the discovery that cutting the corpus callosum is a very effective treatment for patients who suffer from epilepsy . initially after the patients recovered from surgery there were no signs that the surgery caused any changes to their behavior or functioning . this observation rendered the question : if the surgery had absolutely no effect on any part of the patients ' normal functioning then what is the purpose of the corpus callosum ? was it simply there to keep the two sides of the brain from collapsing , as karl lashley jokingly put it ? sperry was asked to develop a series of tests to perform on the `` split-brain '' patients to determine if the surgery caused changes in the patients ' functioning or not . working with his graduate student michael gazzaniga , sperry invited several of the `` split-brain '' patients to volunteer to take part in his study to determine if the surgery affected their functioning . these tests were designed to test the patients ' language , vision , and motor skills . when a person views something in the left visual field ( that is on the left side of their body ) , the information travels to the right hemisphere of the brain and vice versa . in the first series of tests , sperry would present a word to either the left or right visual field for a short period of time . if the word was shown to the right visual field , meaning the left hemisphere would process it , then the patient could report seeing the word . if the word was shown to the left visual field , meaning the right hemisphere would process it , then the patient could not report seeing the word . this led sperry to believe that only the left side of the brain could articulate speech . however , in a follow-up experiment , sperry discovered that the right hemisphere does have some language abilities . in this experiment , he had the patients place their left hands in a tray full of objects located under a partition so the patient would not be able to see the objects . then a word was shown to the patient 's left visual field , which was processed by the right side of the brain . this word described one of the objects in the tray , so the patient 's left hand picked up the object corresponding to the word . when participants were asked about the word and the object in their hand , they claimed they had not seen the word and had no idea why they were holding the object . the right side of the brain had recognized the word and told the left hand to pick it up , but because the right side of the brain can not speak and the left side of the brain had not seen the word , the patient could not articulate what they had seen . in another series of experiments further examining the lateralization of language in the left and right hemispheres , sperry presented one object to the left visual field and a different object to the right visual field of the `` split-brain '' patients . the patient 's left hand was put under a partition and then the patient was asked to draw with their left hand what they had been shown . the patients would draw what they had seen in their left visual field , but when asked what they had drawn would describe what had been shown to their right visual field . these tests proved that when the corpus callosum is severed , it breaks the connection between the left and right hemispheres , making them unable to communicate with each other . not only are they unable to communicate with each other , but also without the corpus callosum connecting them one hemisphere has no idea that the other hemisphere even exists . there was even evidence of this outside the laboratory when some of the patients reported that , `` while their left hand was unbuttoning their shirt , the right hand would follow along behind and button it again . '' these experiments were beneficial to numerous people in many different ways . in his words , each hemisphere is : indeed a conscious system in its own right , perceiving , thinking , remembering , reasoning , willing , and emoting , all at a characteristically human level , and ... both the left and the right hemisphere may <days> conscious simultaneously in different , even in mutually conflicting , mental experiences that run along in parallel this research contributed greatly to understanding the lateralization of brain function . in <year> , sperry also received the national medal of science . afterwards in <year> , sperry received the lifetime achievement award from apa . in addition to his contribution in establishing the lateralized function of the brain , sperry is noted for his `` chemoaffinity hypothesis '' , which has not only been influential in formation of testable hypotheses in how precise neuronal wiring diagram is established in the brain , but the hypothesis itself has been verified by numerous experiments . the cells and fibers of the brain must carry some kind of individual identification tags , presumably cytochemical in nature , by which they are distinguished one from another almost , in many regions , to the level of the single neurons in the words of a <year> review article in science magazine : `` he suggested that gradients of such identification tags on retinal neurons and on the target cells in the brain coordinately guide the orderly projection of millions of developing retinal axons . this idea was supported by the identification and genetic analysis of axon guidance molecules , including those that direct development of the vertebrate visual system . '' this was confirmed in the seventies by marshall w. nirenberg 's work on chick retinas and later on drosophila melanogaster larvae.the experiments conducted by sperry focused on four major ideas which were also called `` turnarounds '' : equipotentiality , split brain studies , nerve regeneration and plasticity , and psychology of the consciousness . == personal life == in <year> , sperry married norma gay deupree . they had one son , glenn michael , and one daughter , janeth hope . sperry was a quiet , thoughtful , and modest man with an insatiable curiosity . he never stopped working , questioning , or learning up until his death in <year> of als or lou gehrig 's disease . sperry could often be found in his office with his feet propped up on his desk scribbling in his notebook or deep in thought . sperry was an avid paleontologist and displayed his large fossil collection in his home . he was also a very talented sculptor , artist , and ceramicist . he enjoyed going on camping and fishing trips with his wife and children in baja , california . == awards and honors == == bibliography == == references == == external links == roger w. sperry on nobelprize.org otmar emminger ( <integer> march <year> – <integer> august <year> ) was a german economist who served as the president of the deutsche bundesbank from <year> to <year> . == early life and education == emminger was born in augsburg on <integer> march <year> . in <year> , he received a phd from the university of munich . == career and activities == emminger was a lecturer at his alma mater . he began to work at the deutsche bundesbank <days> october <year> . from <integer> april <year> to <integer> december <year> he was board member of the bank . in addition , he served as west germany 's executive director at the international monetary fund from <year> to <year> . he was vice president of the bank from <integer> january <year> to <integer> may <year> . he was appointed president of the bank on <integer> june <year> , succeeding karl klasen in the post . karl otto pöhl became his deputy . emminger 's term lasted until <integer> december <year> . he was replaced by pöhl in the post.in july <year> , he began to serve as an advisor to the philippines government ( corazon aquino had become president <days> february <year> ) on behalf of west germany . at the same time he published his memoirs . == death == emminger died of a heart attack in manila , the philippines , at the age of <integer> <days> august <year> . == works == die englischen währungsexperimente der nachkriegszeit-währungsentwertung und krisenüberwindung dissertation , munich <year> ( in : weltwirtschaftliches archiv <integer> ( <year> ) , s. 270–325 ) zwischenbilanz der dm-aufwertung ( <year> ) inflation and the international monetary system ( <year> ) on the way to a new international monetary order ( <year> ) verteidigung der dm . plädoyers für stabiles geld , frankfurt am main <year> ( autobiography ) d-mark , dollar , währungskrisen . erinnerungen eines ehemaligen bundesbankpräsidenten , deutsche verlags-anstalt , <year> , isbn <days> . == references == == external links == yegor timurovich gaidar ( russian : его́р тиму́рович гайда́р ;

his grandfather , originally called `` golikov '' , adopted the name `` gaidar '' from the khakas language as a nom-de-plume . gaidar married the daughter of writer arkady strugatsky during his time at the university . his daughter , maria gaidar , was one of the leaders of the russian democratic opposition . from july <year> till june <year> she was deputy chair of the government of kirov oblast . in <year> and <year> she was vice-governor of odessa oblast in ukraine . == career == gaidar graduated with honors from the moscow state university , faculty of economics , in <year> and worked as a researcher in several academic institutes . a long-time member of the communist party of the soviet union and an editor of the cpsu ideological journal communist during the perestroika , he joined boris yeltsin 's camp during perestroika . in <year> he quit the communist party and was promoted to yeltsin 's government . while in government , gaidar advocated free market economic reforms according to the principle of shock therapy . his best-known decision was to abolish price regulation by the state , which immediately resulted in a major increase in prices and amounted to officially authorizing a market economy in russia . he also cut military procurement and industrial subsidies , and reduced the budget deficit . gaidar was the first vice-premier of the russian government and minister of economics from <year> until <year> , and minister of finance from february <year> until april <year> . he was appointed acting prime minister under president boris yeltsin in <year> from <integer> june until <integer> december <days> when the anti-yeltsin russian congress of people 's deputies refused to confirm gaidar in this position and viktor chernomyrdin was eventually chosen as a compromise figure . gaidar continued to advise the new government . on <integer> september <year> , he was again appointed the first vice-premier under chernomyrdin as a deliberate snub to the opposition . he played an active role in the russian constitutional crisis of <year> . on <integer> october <days> he famously spoke live on russian television , then broadcasting from an emergency station near moscow , as there was fighting going on in the ostankino complex , calling on muscovites to gather to defend yeltsin 's government so that russia would not be `` turned into an enormous concentration camp for decades '' .in the <year> duma elections , in the aftermath of the crisis , gaidar led the pro-government bloc russia 's choice and was seen by some as a possible future prime minister . however , due to the bloc 's failure to win the plurality of votes in the election , gaidar 's role in the government diminished and he finally resigned on <integer> january <year> . during the <year> nato bombing of yugoslavia yegor gaidar , boris nemtsov and boris fyodorov were in belgrade , yugoslavia on a mediation mission . === reforms controversy === gaidar was often criticized for imposing ruthless reforms in <year> with little care for their social impact ; however , it has to be understood that the country back then was at the brink of a famine . russia had no currency for buying import goods , at the same time , no-one gave credits as the country was essentially bankrupt . the collapse of the soviet social system led to serious deterioration in living standards . millions of russians were thrown into poverty due to their savings being devalued by massive hyperinflation . moreover , the privatization and break-up of state assets left over from the soviet union , which he played a big part in , led to much of the country 's wealth being handed to a small group of powerful business executives , later known as the russian oligarchs , for much less than what they were worth . the voucher privatization program enabled these few oligarchs to become billionaires specifically by arbitraging the vast difference between old domestic prices for russian commodities and the prices prevailing on the world market . because they stashed billions of dollars in swiss bank accounts rather than investing in the russian economy , these oligarchs were dubbed `` kleptocrats . '' as society grew to despise these figures and resent the economic and social turmoil caused by the reforms , gaidar was often held by russians as one of the men most responsible . on the other hand , the ubiquitous goods deficit of the soviet years disappeared and it became possible to buy all goods in the shops . per capita calorie consumption under gaidar diminished by 3.5 % from 2526.88 kcal to 2438.17 kcal.according to franklin foer writing in the atlantic , however , `` when yegor gaidar ... asked the united states for help hunting down the billions that the kgb had carted away , the white house refused . `` one of gaidar 's most outspoken critics was the yabloko economist and mp grigory yavlinsky , who had proposed since <year> a <integer> days programme for the transition of the whole ussr to market economic , which was first backed and then dismissed by the government of nikolai ryzhkov . yavlinsky emphasized the differences between his and gaidar 's reforms program , such as the sequencing of privatization vs. liberalization of prices and the applicability of his program to the entire soviet union . gaidar 's supporters contend that although many mistakes were made , he had few choices in the matter and ultimately saved the country both from bankruptcy and from starvation . according to the bbc 's andrei ostalski , `` there were only two solutions—either introduce martial law and severe rationing , or radically liberalize the economy . the first option meant going all the way back to the stalinist system of mass repression . the second meant a colossal change , a journey—or , rather , a race—through uncharted waters with an unpredictable outcome . '' === poisoning case === <days> november <year> gaidar went to dublin , ireland to present his book 'death of the empire : lessons for modern russia ' at an academic conference . shortly after breakfast , a fruit salad and a cup of tea , gaidar felt sick and returned from the conference hall to his room at the hotel . then he was called on the phone to come down and deliver his speech , what gaidar has later recalled as a call that saved his life , as he must had certainly died if were left in his room unattended . after gaidar had tried to deliver his speech he collapsed in the university hallway and was urgently taken a to local hospital . his colleague , ekaterina genieva , recalled that `` he was lying on the floor unconscious . there was blood coming from his nose ; he was vomiting blood . this went on for more than half an hour '' .next day he moved from the hospital to the russian embassy 's premises and arranged a transfer to moscow where the doctors familiar with his health status suggested that it looks like he was 'poisoned'.in a later interview that was published in the ft gaidar claimed that this has been an attempted political murder , where `` most likely that means that some obvious or hidden adversaries of the russian authorities stand behind the scenes of this event , those who are interested in further radical deterioration of relations between russia and the west '' .another russian reformist official and former colleague of gaidar , anatoly chubais rejected a possibility of kremlin 's involvement in this case , commenting that `` yegor gaidar was on the verge of death on <integer> november <days> the deadly triangle - politkovskaya , litvinenko and gaidar - would have been very desirable for some people who are seeking an unconstitutional and forceful change of power in russia . '' irish police opened an official investigation of the case . one of the versions voiced by the russian opposition leaders and kremlin supporters suggested that boris berezovsky , then a russian oligarch in exile <days> may have been behind it . andrey illarionov , former putin 's adviser now living in the us , commented that the whole case was staged , and the reason for taking gaidar to hospital must have been hyperthensia , stress or alcohol . == death == gaidar died at the age of <integer> in odintsovo raion , moscow oblast , russia . gaidar 's aide valery natarov stated that gaidar died unexpectedly , early on <integer> december <year> , at his moscow oblast home while he was working on a book for children . gaidar died of pulmonary edema , provoked by myocardial ischemia . he is survived by his wife , three sons and daughter.gaidar was regarded as an object of loathing among ordinary russians who lost everything during the shock therapy economic reforms.exiled russian oligarch mikhail khodorkovsky and convicted fraudster platon lebedev expressed their condolences . `` he laid the foundation of our economy '' .russian president dmitry medvedev has expressed condolences to relatives and friends of yegor gaidar . medvedev called gaidar a `` daring , honest and decisive '' economist who `` evoked respect among his supporters and opponents . '' `` the death of gaidar is a heavy loss for russia , '' says russian prime minister vladimir putin . `` we have lost a genuine citizen and patriot , a strong spirited person , a talented scientist , writer and expert .... he did n't dodge responsibility and 'took the punch ' in the most challenging situations with honor and courage , '' the statement said.the white house offered condolences over gaidar 's death . u.s. national security council spokesman mike hammer said that , although controversial , gaidar 's legacy formed the foundation of a dynamic market-based economy . === gaidar forum

) was a german physician , biologist and behavioral physiologist . together with erwin bünning and colin pittendrigh , he is considered to be a co-founder of the field of chronobiology.aschoff 's work in the field of chronobiology introduced the idea that shifting one 's light-dark cycle can result in harmful effects , such as correlations with mental illness . == life == aschoff was born in freiburg im breisgau as the fifth child of the pathologist ludwig aschoff ( known for discovering the aschoff-tawara or atrioventricular node ) and his wife clara . he grew up in the liberal but morally strict world of prussian academia . after the abitur at a humanistic high school , he – according to his own statement `` lacking a specific interest '' – studied medicine at the university of bonn , where he joined the burschenschaft ( fraternity ) alemannia bonn . aschoff ’ s scientific career began in <year> , when he moved to the university of göttingen to study thermoregulation physiology with hermann rein . in <year> , he received the venia legendi . he then became a professor at the university of göttingen in 1949.in <year> , his mentor , hermann rein , was appointed director of the max planck institute for medical research in heidelberg . rein brought aschoff to the institute as a collaborator to study circadian rhythms in humans , birds , and mice . aschoff then moved to the max planck institute for behavioral physiology in andechs to work with gustav kramer , who showed time-compensated sun-compass navigation in birds , and erich von holst , who studied physiological oscillators . from <year> to <year> , he was a director at the max planck institute for behavioral physiology and an extraordinary professor in munich . aschoff was a scientific member and a member of the kollegiums of the max planck institute for behavior physiology , as well as senator of the max planck society from <year> to <year> . aschoff was known as an excellent lecturer with a booming voice , and he took a special interest in creating a scientific community and encouraging young scientists . after his retirement in <year> and return to freiburg , aschoff continued his scientific work in the form of further publications . only the death of his wife hilde broke his unusual vitality . jürgen aschoff died ten months after his wife in <year> , after a short illness at the age of <integer> years . == work == aschoff provided a strong foundation for the field of chronobiology through his research on circadian rhythms and entrainment in many different organisms such as rats , mice , birds , macaques , monkeys , and humans . his early research focused on understanding the properties of circadian rhythms and how these rhythms can change in response to stimuli . his later work was more applicable to pathologies , such as psychiatric disorders and dangers of shift work schedules , which can result from manipulating specific zeitgebers . aschoff 's work in the field of chronobiology introduced the idea that shifting one 's light-dark cycle can result in harmful effects , such as correlations with mental illness . === early work === aschoff began his research on the physiology of thermoregulation by self-experimentation . he discovered that there was a <other> rhythm of variation in body temperature . after these experiments , he began investigating the basic mechanisms of circadian rhythm . in the 1950s , he met and began to collaborate with erwin bünning and colin pittendrigh . aschoff began further experimentation studying the circadian rhythms of birds and mice under constant conditions . his results led to the conclusion that circadian oscillations of biological processes were innate and did not require prior exposure to a <other> day to be expressed.aschoff also applied these methods to experiments with human circadian rhythms by building an underground `` bunker '' to isolate human subjects from any external environmental cues . subjects placed in this bunker were allowed to turn lights on or off according to their own internal rhythms . after over twenty years of tracking sleep-wake cycles , body temperature , urine output , and other physiological and behavioral outputs , aschoff and his collaborator rütger wever concluded that humans have endogenous circadian oscillators . this discovery has become the foundation for our understanding of many medical problems such as aging , sleep disorders , and jet lag.in <year> , aschoff coined the term zeitgeber ( from german for `` time giver '' or `` synchronizer '' ) to refer to external , environmental cues that synchronize an endogenous oscillator to the environmental cycle . to investigate the properties of natural endogenous oscillators , aschoff exposed organisms to constant conditions without zeitgeber cues ( either constant light or constant darkness ) . the observations from this paper were formulated into the fundamental rules of biological clocks . === aschoff 's rule === from the experiments communicated in <year> , aschoff noted that under constant light conditions , the activity phase shortens in nocturnal organisms and lengthens in diurnal organisms . these trends were termed alpha compression and alpha expansion , respectively . in tribute to his mentor , pittendrigh called this observation `` aschoff 's rule '' in a <year> publication , and the designation remains today.aschoff 's rule is related to the model of parametric entrainment , which assumes continuous phase changes . aschoff and pittendrigh approached the field with different models of how oscillators entrain , which resulted in different predictive models . aschoff 's parametric model states that entrainment occurs through gradual changes in the clock that adapt to a new light-dark cycle . although this is no longer recognized as the correct model in the field , serge daan suggested in <year> that aschoff made qualitative contributions that provide valuable alternatives to inconsistencies in the current field . === later work === much of aschoff 's later work involved tests on human subjects . he found that the absence of a light-dark cycle does not prevent humans from entrainment . rather , knowing the time of day from social cues , such as regular meal times , is sufficient for entrainment . aschoff also found that different circadian outputs such as body temperature and locomotor activity can be either internally synchronized or desynchronized depending on the strength of the zeitgeber . in constant darkness , rectal temperature and sleep onset and duration became desynchronized in some subjects , and the rectal temperature at the time of sleep onset was correlated to the duration of the bout of sleep . he hypothesized that internal desynchronization , the phase differences resulting from period differences between two circadian output processes , could be related to many psychiatric disorders.some of aschoff 's later work also integrated his initial interest in thermoregulation with his work on circadian rhythm . he found a circadian rhythm in thermal conductance , a measurement of heat transfer from the body . minimal conductance in mammals and birds oscillates with circadian phase , with a wide range of conductance values . this allows animals to release heat during their activity period , when they have higher basal metabolism , as well as conserve heat during their rest period , when they have lower basal metabolism . in birds , the circadian rhythm in conductance results mostly from circadian rates of evaporative heat loss . in mammals , the conductance oscillates with circadian rhythms in the body 's heat resistance and blood flow rate.following up on his temperature studies , he found that a mammalian species can entrain to a temperature cycle , but that temperature is a weak zeitgeber compared to a light-dark cycle.aschoff described masking signals as inputs that circumvent the pacemaker but nevertheless lead to modulation of a circadian behavior that is also controlled by the pacemaker . parametric entrainment is entrainment that does not result from an instant change in phase , as governed by a phase response curve , as in the case of masking signals . the term aschoff used for this phenomenon is “ arousal ” due to non-photic zeitgebers . data from experimental assays show a relationship between masking effects and phase , leading to a “ demasking ” effect whereby animals arrhythmic in constant conditions have free-running periods in high frequency light-dark cycles . aschoff concluded that the oscillator or circadian clock “ integrates ” over the intensity of light to which it has been exposed , and then responds with a change in the period of activity , as seen in greenfinches , chaffinches , hamsters , and siskins . aschoff concluded , however , that non-parametric effects , as opposed to parametric effects , are the principal source of entrainment . === aschoff–wever model === <integer> ) an increase in the duration of sunset advances the phase of an organism for nocturnal and diurnal animals . <integer> ) an increase in strength of the zeitgeber should increase as sunset duration increases . === influence on other researchers === aschoff has published articles with both pittendrigh and serge daan , the latter also a pivotal researcher in chronobiology . in his recent work , daan has attempted to reconcile the idea of parametric entrainment to light proposed by aschoff with the non-parametric model of entrainment proposed by pittendrigh , and results from a <year> paper from daan 's lab lend further evidence to aschoff 's model of parametric entrainment.although aschoff ’ s collaboration with gustav kramer was never fully realized due to the latter ’ s sudden death , aschoff continued to use birds as model organisms and work with ornithologists . == aschoff 's rule ( prize ) == at a dinner held in aschoff 's honor at the <year> gordon conference on chronobiology , professor till roenneberg initiated the annual giving of the aschoff 's rule prize to scientists who have advanced the field of chronobiology by presenting a plaque with a ruler on it to professor maroli k. chandrashekera . recipients choose the winner the following year and must follow two guidelines : the successor should be

and geneticist . originally an aeronautical engineer during the second world war , he took a second degree in genetics under the well-known biologist j . b. s. haldane . maynard smith was instrumental in the application of game theory to evolution with george r. price , and theorised on other problems such as the evolution of sex and signalling theory . == biography == === early years === john maynard smith was born in london , the son of the surgeon sidney maynard smith , but following his father 's death in <year> , the family moved to exmoor , where he became interested in natural history . quite unhappy with the lack of formal science education at eton college , maynard smith took it upon himself to develop an interest in darwinian evolutionary theory and mathematics , after having read the work of old etonian j . b. s. haldane , whose books were in the school 's library despite the bad reputation haldane had at eton for his communism . he became an atheist at age 14.on leaving school , maynard smith joined the communist party of great britain and started studying engineering at trinity college , cambridge . when the second world war broke out in <year> , he defied his party 's line and volunteered for service . he was rejected , however , because of poor eyesight and was told to finish his engineering degree , which he did in <year> . he later quipped that `` under the circumstances , my poor eyesight was a selective advantage—it stopped me getting shot '' . the year of his graduation , he married sheila matthew , and they later had two sons and one daughter ( tony , carol , and julian ) . between <year> and <year> , he applied his degree to military aircraft design . === second degree === maynard smith , having decided that aircraft were `` noisy and old-fashioned '' , then took a change of career , entering university college london to study fruit fly genetics under haldane . after graduating he became a lecturer in zoology at his alma mater between <year> and <year> , where he directed the drosophila lab and conducted research on population genetics . he published a popular penguin book , the theory of evolution , in <year> ( with subsequent editions in <year> , <year> , <year> ) . he became gradually less attracted to communism and became a less active member , finally leaving the party in <year> like many other intellectuals , after the soviet union brutally suppressed the hungarian revolution ( haldane had left the party in <year> after becoming similarly disillusioned ) . he also admitted that a research program in evolutionary biology explicitly informed by marxism seemed to bear little fruit . === university of sussex === in <year> he was one of the founding members of the university of sussex and was a dean between 1965–85 . he subsequently became a professor emeritus . prior to his death the building housing much of life sciences at sussex was renamed the john maynard smith building in his honour . === evolution and the theory of games === in <year> maynard smith formalised a central concept in evolutionary game theory called the evolutionarily stable strategy , based on a verbal argument by george r. price . this area of research culminated in his <year> book evolution and the theory of games . the hawk-dove game is arguably his single most influential game theoretical model . he was elected a fellow of the royal society in <year> . in <year> he was awarded the darwin medal . === evolution of sex and other major transitions in evolution === maynard smith published a book titled the evolution of sex which explored in mathematical terms , the notion of the `` two-fold cost of sex '' . during the late 1980s he also became interested in the other major evolutionary transitions with the evolutionary biologist eörs szathmáry . together they wrote an influential <year> book the major transitions in evolution , a seminal work which continues to contribute to ongoing issues in evolutionary biology . a popular science version of the book , the origins of life : from the birth of life to the origin of language , was published in <year> . in <year> he was awarded the balzan prize for genetics and evolution `` for his powerful analysis of evolutionary theory and of the role of sexual reproduction as a critical factor in evolution and in the survival of species ; for his

communist period , especially during the croatian spring when she was deposed . she returned to politics during the early days of croatian independence as the leader of the coalition of people 's accord and the croatian people 's party . from <year> to <year> she served as the chairman of the 5th executive council ( prime minister ) of the socialist republic of croatia , one of eight constituent republics and autonomous provinces of the socialist federative republic of yugoslavia . she was the first woman in europe to be appointed head of government of a political entity and the first female in the post-world war ii croatia to hold an office equivalent to a head of government . == early life == savka dabčević-kučar ( née dabčević ) was born on <integer> december <year> in korčula , then in the kingdom of serbs , croats and slovenes , today in croatia . during the world war ii , she joined yugoslav partisans , the communist party of yugoslavia ( kpj ) and the communist party of croatia ( kph ) in <year> . in <year> , she was transferred to the el shatt refugee camp . in <year> she enrolled in the study of economics at the university of zagreb and two years later transferred to the leningrad university – returning to complete her study in zagreb in <year> following the tito–stalin split . she married ante kučar in <year> . dabčević-kučar received phd in economics from the university of zagreb in <year> . she became a member of the central committee of the league of communists of croatia ( skh - previously known as the kph ) in <year> . two years later , she received a grant from the ford foundation and studied economic development and regional planning in the united states and france . in <year> , she was appointed a member of the skh 's task group formed to develop a proposal for economic reforms . in <year> she became a professor at the faculty of economics of the university of zagreb.dabčević-kučar came into the public spotlight in the late 1960s as a member of a younger and more reformist generation of the league of communists of yugoslavia leaders . with the tacit blessing of josip broz tito , she and miko tripalo became the leaders of the skh . in <year> she became the president of the executive council ( prime minister ) of the socialist republic of croatia , a constituent republic of sfr yugoslavia , giving her the distinction of being the first female head of government of a political entity in europe . == career == in the late 1960s , the party adopted a new course demanding greater autonomy for croatia within yugoslavia and freedoms for the people . her policy , propagated through mass rallies , became a movement later called the croatian spring , being one of the '68 student revolutions . consequently , dabčević-kučar became one of the most popular political leaders at the time , being affectionately called `` savka , queen of croatians '' . not everyone was happy with the new course . open manifestations of croatian nationalism created tensions in ethnically mixed areas , which served as an argument for the yugoslav people 's army and more conservative elements of the party who wanted the movement suppressed . at the same time , the croatian leadership was also challenged by a student movement with even more radical demands . <days> december <year> tito held a party leadership conference in karađorđevo , serbia , and publicly turned against the croatian spring in the form of `` comradely critic '' , ( an internal communist way to openly criticize its party members when they , according to majority opinion , do not follow `` the party line '' ) . this led to dabčević-kučar 's response to the critic , ( published in newspapers during december <days> in which she accepted all criticism except those intended to show her as nationalist , and enemy of the socialist self-governing system , to which she publicly expressed loyalty . she resigned from the central committee of the croatian communist party and , ultimately , from public life . she was replaced by milka planinc . when multi-party democracy finally arrived in croatia , dabčević-kučar and tripalo returned to the public stage , using their long-accumulated reputation . they refused to endorse a single party , and instead initiated the formation of a broad coalition of the moderate middle , called the coalition of people 's accord . the coalition failed to make a major impact at the <year> elections , with most opting for franjo tuđman and his croatian democratic union party . with the coalition falling apart , dabčević-kučar and tripalo formed their own party , the croatian people 's party ( hns ) , in late <year> . this new party was intended to attract moderates and had high hopes for the <year> presidential and parliamentary elections , being perceived as the strongest opposition party in croatia . as a presidential candidate savka dabčević trailed third behind dražen budiša . the hns refused to form coalitions with other opposition parties , allowing the ruling croatian democratic union to win some constituencies with less than fifth of all votes . with the party humiliated , and nearly bankrupt after a lavish but ineffective campaign , the aging dabčević-kučar left the party leadership to the younger radimir čačić . == personal life == she died in zagreb at the age of

economics was the concept of x-inefficiency and the critical minimum effort thesis in development economics . concerning his `` critical minimum effort thesis '' , he says that the underdeveloped countries are trapped by the vicious circle of poverty and many other growth retarding factors which keep them in the state of backwardness . so these countries need to increase their per capita income to a certain level where they can maintain a self-sustained growth rate : they need a critical minimum effort , i.e. , they need to invest at more than a minimum level to overcome all the obstacles of the underdeveloped countries . in economics , x-efficiency is the effectiveness with which a given set of inputs are used to produce outputs . if a firm is producing the maximum output it can , given the resources it employs , such as men and machinery , and the best technology available , it is said to be technical-efficient . x-inefficiency occurs when technical-efficiency is not achieved . the concept of x-efficiency is also used in the theory of bureaucracy . == selected publications == <year> , `` bandwagon , snob and veblen effects in the theory of consumer demand '' ,

control of various embassies , which had extraterritorial conventions that gave them an equivalent to sovereignty . they could provide asylum for jews.when sanz briz was transferred from hungary to switzerland <days> november <year> , he invited perlasca to accompany him to safety . however , perlasca chose to remain in hungary . the hungarian government ordered the spanish embassy building and the extraterritorial houses where the jews took refuge to be cleared out . perlasca immediately made the false announcement that sanz briz was due to return from a short leave , and that he had been appointed his deputy for the meantime . throughout the winter , perlasca was active in hiding , shielding and feeding thousands of jews in budapest . he continued issuing safe conduct passes ( initiated by sanz briz ) , on the basis of a spanish law passed in <year> that granted citizenship to jews of sephardic origin ( descendants of iberian jews expelled from spain in the late 15th century ) .in december <year> , perlasca rescued two boys from being herded onto a freight train in defiance of a german lieutenant colonel on the scene . the swedish diplomat-rescuer raoul wallenberg , also present there , later told perlasca that the officer who had challenged him was adolf eichmann . over <integer> days , from <integer> december <year> to <integer> january <year> , perlasca helped save more than 5,000 jews , about four times more than those saved by oskar schindler.according to perlasca , he also prevented the execution of a plan to demolish the budapest ghetto with around 60,000 people in it , as the nazis had done in warsaw . while perlasca was posing as the spanish consul-general , he learned of the intentions of the ss and the far-right hungarian arrow cross to destroy the ghetto . shocked and incredulous , he asked for a direct hearing with the hungarian interior minister , gábor vajna , and threatened him with legal and economic measures against the `` 3,000 hungarian citizens '' ( in fact , a much smaller number ) declared by perlasca as residents of spain , unless he withdrew the plan . perlasca also offered to help vajna and his family escape from hungary before the advancing soviet army reached budapest . the plan to raze the budapest ghetto was subsequently cancelled . == after the war == after the war , perlasca returned to italy . he did not talk about his actions in hungary to anyone , including his family , and lived a quiet life . in <year> , a group of hungarian jews whom he had saved finally found him after searching for him for <integer> years in spain . there was publicity at the time , and perlasca became noted for his heroic deeds . enrico deaglio wrote an account of his remarkable heroism , banality of goodness , ( <year> ) , which became a bestseller . the book was adapted as a made-for-tv film , perlasca – un eroe italiano ( <year> ) , by the rai national television corporation , not to be confused with the <year> movie perlasca . giorgio perlasca died of a heart attack in <year> . == decorations and honors == in <year> perlasca was made an honorary citizen of israel and was honored by the yad vashem holocaust memorial museum with a stele and a 10,000 tree forest . perlasca was designated by israel as a righteous among the nations in <year> for his efforts star of merit , hungary , <year> knesset

marsden was born in croydon in <year> . he trained in medicine at st thomas ' hospital london . he was awarded intercalated bachelor of science and master of science degrees in <year> on the subject of pigmentation of the substantia nigra . he obtained his bachelor of medicine , bachelor of surgery ( mbbs ) in <year> , and became a member of the royal college physicians ( mrcp ) in <year> . == career and research == he was a lecturer at st thomas ’ hospital for two years before proceeding to the national hospital for neurology and neurosurgery as a senior resident house physician . in <year> he became honorary consultant neurologist to the maudsley and bethlem royal hospitals and at the king 's college hospital , and also senior lecturer at the institute of psychiatry . he became joint chair of neurology at the institute of psychiatry and kings college hospital medical school in <year> . he succeeded roger gilliat as chair of neurology at the institute of neurology , queen square in <year> , and became the dean of neurology eight years later . he had just started a one year sabbatical at the national institute of health at bethesda for a detailed study of apraxia when he died suddenly from an unsuspected congenital coronary anomaly at the age of <integer> years.marsden ’ s major works were in movement disorders . his interest in this field started with his medical school thesis which was a comparative study of mammalian substantia nigra . after graduation his initial interest was the neurophysiological study of parkinsonian tremor . his later contributions include the complications of levodopa ; the motor control physiology of dystonia , myoclonus , and essential tremor ; the discovery of the mitochondrial defect in the substantia nigra in parkinson 's disease ; and the use of fluorodopa positron emission tomography ( pet ) to study the growth of embryonic tissue transplants in parkinson ’ s disease . he described several neurological conditions such as painful legs/moving toes , cortical and corticospinal myoclonus , and primary writing tremor . he was instrumental in establishing dystonia as an organic disease rather than a hysterical condition , and made a major contribution to its classification . he established the uk parkinson 's disease society´s brain bank . marsden collaborated at king 's college with peter jenner and john rothwell . one of his most important collaborators was stanley fahn who is at the columbia presbyterian hospital in new york ; together they founded the movement disorders journal and the movement

oil exploration business in many countries , using the opportunities arising from his postings to study birdlife around the world . he wrote classic papers on the birds of the red sea , nigeria , the gold coast , indonesia , borneo , ecuador and iraq . in <year> he migrated to australia where he joined the bureau of mineral resources in canberra . == biography == marchant was born in weston-under-lizard , a village in the english county of staffordshire . in australia , marchant was immediately involved in organised ornithology through the royal australasian ornithologists union ( raou ) where he was a strong force for what he perceived to be necessary reform . here he was instrumental in founding the act group of the raou , which later became the canberra ornithologists group ( cog ) . he also initiated the raou nest record scheme and was a founding member of the raou field investigations committee . as part of a reformist makeover of the raou , in order to strengthen its scientific rigor and ornithological credibility , in <year> he became editor of the raou 's journal the emu , which he transformed into an internationally respected scientific journal.following a <other> stint as emu editor , he turned his attention to a new project , a comprehensive handbook of australian birds , an endeavour which expanded in scope to become the handbook of australian , new zealand and antarctic birds ( hanzab ) of which he was the editor-in-chief of the first two volumes.for most of his later years from <year> , he lived at moruya in the eurobodalla shire of the nsw south coast . here , he continued to be active in natural history , helping found the eurobodalla natural history society in <year> , serving as its president as well as editor of its journal nature in eurobodalla . stephen marchant 's earlier ornithological work resulted in the award of the british ornithologists ' union medal in <year> and , later , his election as a corresponding fellow of the american ornithologists ' union . appreciation for his service to the raou led to him being elected a fellow of the raou in <year> . his contribution to australian ornithology was recognised by his being made an honorary member in the general division of the order of australia ( am ) in <year> , and by being awarded the raou 's john hobbs medal in <year> . marchant died <days> august <year> , at

( september <days> , <year> – may <days> , <year> ) was a professor of business history at harvard business school and johns hopkins university , who wrote extensively about the scale and the management structures of modern corporations . his works redefined business and economic history of industrialization . he received the pulitzer prize for history for his work , the visible hand : the managerial revolution in american business ( <year> ) . he has been called `` the doyen of american business historians '' . == family and life == chandler was the great-grandson of henry varnum poor . `` du pont '' was apparently a family name given to his grandfather because his great-grandmother was raised by the du pont family , and there are other connections as well.chandler graduated from phillips exeter academy in <year> and harvard college in <year> . after world war ii , he returned to harvard , finished his m.a . in <year> , and earned his doctorate in <year> under the direction of frederick merk . he taught at m.i.t . and johns hopkins university before arriving at harvard business school in <year> . == publications == chandler used the papers of his ancestor henry varnum poor , a leading analyst of the railway industry , the publisher of the american railroad journal , and a founder of standard & poor 's , as a basis for his ph.d. thesis.chandler began looking at large-scale enterprise in the early 1960s . his book strategy and structure : chapters in the history of the industrial enterprise ( <year> ) examined the organization of e.i . du pont de nemours and company , standard oil of new jersey , general motors , and sears , roebuck and co . he found that managerial organization developed in response to the corporation 's business strategy . the book was voted the eleventh most influential management book of the 20th century in a poll of the fellows of the academy of management.this emphasis on the importance of a cadre of managers to organize and run large-scale corporations was expanded into a `` managerial revolution '' in the visible hand : the managerial revolution in american business ( <year> ) for which he received a pulitzer prize . he pursued that book 's themes further in scale and scope : the dynamics of industrial capitalism , ( <year> ) and co-edited an anthology on the same themes , with franco amatori and takashi hikino , big business and the wealth of nations ( <year> ) . == the visible hand == chandler 's masterwork was the visible hand : the managerial revolution in american business ( <year> ) . his first two chapters looked at traditional owner-operated small business operations in commerce and production , including the largest among them , the slave plantations in the south . chapters <other> summarize the history of railroad management , with stress on innovations not just in technology but also in accounting , finance and statistics . he then turned to the new business operations made possible by the rail system in mass distribution , such as jobbers , department stores and mail order . a quick survey ( ch <integer> ) review mass innovation in mass production . the integration of mass distribution and mass production ( ch <other> ) led to many mergers and the emergence of giant industrial corporations by <year> . management for chandler was much more than the ceo , it was the whole system of techniques and included middle management ( ch <integer> ) as well as the corporate structure of the biggest firms , standard oil , general electric , us steel , and dupont ( ch <other> ) . chandler argued that managerial firms evolved in order to take advantage of productive techniques available after the rail network was in place . these firms had a higher productivity and lower costs resulting in higher profits . the firms created the `` managerial class '' in america because they needed to coordinate the increasingly complex and interdependent system . according to steven usselman , this ability to achieve efficiency through coordination , and not some anti-competitive monopolistic greed by robber barons , explained the high levels of concentration in modern american industry . == organizational synthesis == along with economist oliver e. williamson and historians louis galambos , robert h. wiebe , and thomas c. cochran , chandler was a leading historian of the notion of organizational synthesis.he argued that during the 19th century , the development of new systems based on steam power and electricity created a second industrial revolution , which resulted in much more capital-intensive industries than had the industrial revolution of the previous century . the mobilization of the capital necessary to exploit these new systems required a larger number of workers and managers , and larger physical plants than ever before . more particularly , the thesis of the visible hand is that , counter to other theses regarding how capitalism functions , administrative structure and managerial coordination replaced adam smith 's `` invisible hand '' ( market forces ) as the core developmental and structuring impetus of modern business . in the wake of this increase of industrial scale , three successful models of capitalism emerged , which chandler associated with the three leading countries of the period : great britain ( `` personal capitalism '' ) , the united states ( `` competitive capitalism '' ) and germany ( `` cooperative capitalism . '' ) despite the important differences in these three models , the common thread among the developed nations is that the large industrial firm has been the engine of growth in three ways : first , it has provided focal points for capital and labor on large scales ; second , it became the educator whereby a nation learned the pertinent technology and developed managerial skills ; third , it served as the core around which medium and small firms that supply and serve it grew . == influence == chandler 's work was somewhat ignored in history departments , but proved influential in business , economics , and sociology.in the business field , chandler , along with kenneth r. andrews and igor ansoff , has been credited with the foundational role in introducing and popularizing the concept of business strategy.in sociology , prior to chandler 's research , some sociologists assumed there were no differences between governmental , corporate , and nonprofit organizations . chandler 's focus on corporations clearly demonstrated that there were differences , and this thesis has influenced organizational sociologists ' work since the late 1970s . it also motivated sociologists to investigate and critique chandler 's work more closely , turning up instances in which chandler assumed american corporations acted for reasons of efficiency , when they actually operated in a context of politics or conflict . == see also == business history second industrial revolution james burnham == bibliography == chandler , alfred d. `` the beginnings of 'big business ' in american industry '' business history review <integer> # <integer> ( <year> ) : <other> . chandler , alfred d. jr. , <other> , strategy and structure : chapters in the history of the american industrial enterprise ( mit press ) . chandler , alfred d. jr. ed . <year> , giant enterprise : ford , general motors , and the automobile industry . sources and readings ( harcourt , brace & world ) . chandler , alfred d. `` the railroads : pioneers in modern corporate management '' business history review <integer> # <integer> ( <year> ) : <other> in jstor chandler , alfred d. `` anthracite coal and the beginnings of the industrial revolution in the united states '' business history review <integer> # <integer> ( <year> ) : <other> . chandler , alfred d. jr. <year> , the visible hand : the managerial revolution in american business ( the belknap press of harvard university press ) . chandler , alfred d. jr. and herman daems , eds . <year> , managerial hierarchies : comparative perspectives on the rise of the modern industrial enterprise ( harvard university press ) . chandler , alfred d. `` the emergence of managerial capitalism '' business history review <integer> # <integer> ( <year> ) : <other> . chandler , alfred d. jr. and richard s. tedlow , eds . <year> , the coming of managerial capitalism : a casebook on the history of american economic institutions ( r. d. irwin ) . chandler , alfred d. jr. <year> , scale and scope : the dynamics of industrial capitalism ( the belknap press of harvard university press ) . chandler , alfred d. `` what is a firm ? : a historical perspective '' european economic review <integer> # <integer> ( <year> ) : <other> . chandler , alfred d. jr. and james w. cortada , eds . <year> , a nation transformed by information : how information has shaped the united states from colonial times to the present ( oxford university press ) . chandler , alfred d. jr. <year> , inventing the electronic century : the epic story of the consumer electronics and computer industries ( harvard university press ) . chandler , alfred d. jr. <year> , shaping the industrial century : the remarkable story of the evolution of the modern chemical and pharmaceutical industries ( harvard university press ) . chandler , alfred dupont jr. <year> , the essential alfred chandler : essays toward a historical theory of big business thomas k. mccraw , ed .

obe ( <integer> september <year> – <integer> january <year> ) was a british polymath . in the course of his life he was an ornithologist , explorer , journalist , broadcaster , soldier , guerrilla , ethnologist , museum curator , archaeologist , documentarian , film-maker , conservationist and writer . although often described as an anthropologist , and sometimes referred to as the `` barefoot anthropologist '' , his degree studies at university of cambridge , before he left to live in oxford , were in natural sciences . he was a founder of the social observation organisation mass-observation . he conducted ornithological and anthropological research in sarawak ( <year> ) and the new hebrides ( 1933–35 ) , spent much of his life in borneo ( mainly sarawak ) and finished up in the us , the uk and france , before dying in a road accident in thailand . == early life and education == harrisson was born on <integer> september <year> in buenos aires , argentina , the son of geoffry harnett harrisson ( 1881–1939 ) , an engineer , and marie ellen cole ( 1886–1961 ) . another son , william damer harrisson , was born in <year> . the family lived in concordia , entre ríos where his father had been working as a railway engineer and then manager since <year> . in <year> , at the start of the first world war , the family sailed to the united kingdom where geoffry harrisson joined the british army . he was highly decorated for his service and eventually rose to the rank of brigadier-general.harrisson was socially isolated throughout these early years , with no friends apart from his brother . his father was away in the army , and his mother showed little interest in her children . the family moved frequently , and harrisson later recalled no `` lived in , loved place '' . with no toys to occupy them , their nanny kitty asbury entertained her charges with long country walks , which stimulated a great interest in nature . harrisson had learnt to read by the age of five by studying asbury 's books on natural history.in <year> , harrisson 's parents moved back to argentina , `` dumping '' – as harrisson later described it – their sons at eastacre preparatory school and later winton house preparatory school , winchester . school holidays were spent unhappily as paying guests at various vicarages . there was a brief interlude during <year> and <year> , when harrisson and his brother were taken back to argentina by their father . it was to be the best year of his childhood . with his father as teacher , he learnt to hunt , fly-fish and climb . he became interested in birds : he built an aviary and studied their behaviour . socially and linguistically isolated in argentina , he also felt a stranger in england , even more so after his year in south america . in a <year> radio interview , he reflected on this period , and stated that `` this feeling both of belonging intensely , emotionally , sentimentally with england and yet of not belonging to it and finding its habits and its people and its voices and its faces strange keeps on producing sensations even to this day of strangeness wherever i go '' .harrisson attended harrow school from <year> to <year> , a boarder in the house of his sympathetic godfather , rev . d. b. kittermaster , who was particularly supportive of boys such as harrisson who were rebellious and did not fit in . harrisson had little interest in interacting with his fellow schoolboys , but nevertheless took an intense interest in them , keeping a card index on every boy . he was also fascinated by issues of hierarchy and status at the school . he continued his interest in ornithology , and supported by his housemaster , who allowed him to roam beyond the school grounds , he wrote and published a book on birds of the area . after participating in several bird censuses , at the age of <integer> he organized <year> other birdwatchers in a pioneering census of the great crested grebe . the census later became a fixture of british birdwatching , and brought him in contact with many of the leading figures of natural sciences when he continued his education at pembroke college , cambridge . harrisson enjoyed friendship with such as malcolm lowry but abandoned his studies at cambridge for the ambience of oxford , whence he participated in expeditions organised with oxford university exploration club - notably a <integer> month long expedition to northern sarawak in <year> , and then a longer one to the new hebrides from <year> to <year> . in <year> , harrisson , with humphrey jennings and charles madge , founded mass-observation , a project to study the everyday lives of ordinary people in britain . an early project , worktown , was based in bolton . his cousin , bbc world service broadcaster anne symonds ( mother of the journalist matthew symonds by john beavan , baron ardwick ) , worked with him at mass-observation for a time . == personal life == harrisson married three times . in <year> he was named as correspondent in the divorce of bertha clayton ( <other> ) ; they had a son , maxwell barr ( <other> ) , in <year> , but divorced in <year> . he met barbara brunig when she worked at his sarawak museum ; they married in london in <year> , but divorced in <year> after he had met christine forani ( <other> ) , a belgian sculptor ; they married in <year> . the couple were killed in thailand when the bus they were travelling in collided with a truck . they were cremated in bangkok following thai customs . == military service == during the second world war harrisson continued directing mass-observation and was radio critic for the observer from may <year> until june <year> . for much of this time he was in the army and gave up reviewing on leaving the uk . after service in the ranks he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the reconnaissance corps on <integer> november <year> . he had been recruited ( some sources say by a confusion of names , despite his apparent suitability ) for a plan to use the native peoples of borneo against the japanese . he was attached to z special unit ( also known as z force ) , part of the services reconnaissance department ( srd : a branch of the combined allied intelligence bureau in the south west pacific theatre ) . on <integer> march <year> , he was parachuted with seven z force operatives from a consolidated liberator onto a high plateau occupied by the kelabit people . an autobiographical account of this operation ( semut i , one of four semut operations in the area ) is given in world within ( cresset press , <year> ) ; there are also reports – not always flattering – from some of his comrades . his efforts to rescue stranded american airmen shot down over borneo are a central part of `` the airmen and the headhunters '' , an episode of the pbs television series secrets of the dead . the recommendation for his distinguished service order which was gazetted on <integer> march <year> ( and dated <integer> november <year> ) describes how from his insertion until <integer> august <year> the forces under his command protected the flank of allied advances , and caused severe disruption to japanese operations . == ethnological work == following the war , he was curator of the sarawak museum 1947–1966 ( although he did not relinquish his commission until <integer> march <year> ) . in the 1950s and 1960s tom and barbara harrisson undertook pioneering excavations in the west mouth of the great cave at niah , sarawak . their most important discovery was a human skull in deposits dated by radiocarbon to about 40,000 years ago , the earliest date for modern humans in borneo . the results of their excavations were never published in an appropriate manner leading to uncertainty and doubts as to their results ; however , they are largely vindicated by results of excavations carried out by the niah cave project from <year> to <year> . three films ( amongst more made for british tv ) record the niah workat the start of the brunei revolt in <year> , resident john fisher of the 4th division of sarawak called on the dayak tribes for help by sending a boat with the traditional red feather of war up the baram river . tom harrisson also arrived in brunei . he summoned the kelabits from the highlands around bario in the 5th division , the centre of his wartime resistance . hundreds of dayaks responded , and formed into companies led by british civilians all commanded by harrisson . this force reached some 2,000 strong , and with excellent knowledge of the tracks through the interior ( there were no roads ) , helped contain the rebels . and cut off their escape route to indonesia . == legacy == the title of his biography , the most offending soul alive , gives a flavour of the strong feelings he engendered , but he also had many admirers and is recognised as a pioneer in several areas . harrisson was appointed an officer of the order of the british empire in the <year> new year honours , for his work as curator.harrisson 's series the borneo story was broadcast by bbc television in <year> ; a subsequent series was produced by itv in <other> . a documentary tom harrisson – the barefoot anthropologist , hosted by david attenborough , was first broadcast on bbc4 early in 2007.the bornean subspecies of the sumatran rhinoceros is named after him as didermocerus sumatrensis harrissoni groves , 1965the <year> novel l'adieu au roi by pierre schoendoerffer was inspired by events from tom harrisson 's wartime borneo ; the book was later turned into a film by john milius – farewell to the king . sam lightner , jr. 's book all elevations unknown : an adventure in the heart of borneo ( broadway , <year> ) , tells harrisson 's world war ii story in chapters that alternate with lightner 's account of his own climb of batu lawi in the kelabit highlands of sarawak . == publications == as well as numerous papers and monographs in scientific journals , especially the sarawak museum journal , books he authored include : harrisson , t.h .

carroll milton williams ( december <days> , <year> in oregon hill , virginia — october <days> , <year> in watertown , massachusetts ) was an american zoologist known for his work in entomology and developmental biology—in particular , metamorphosis in insects , for which he won the george ledlie prize . he performed groundbreaking surgical experiments on larvae and pupae , and developed multiple new techniques , including the use of carbon dioxide as an anesthetic . his impact on entomology has been compared to that of vincent wigglesworth . == education == williams was educated at the university of richmond and harvard university , where he was awarded a phd in zoology in <year> . elected to the harvard society of fellows , he also earned an md summa cum laude . == career and research == for his thesis he studied the wingbeat frequency of drosophila , using a stroboscopic device which he designed with the advice of harold edgerton . next he studied the endocrine control of the development of the giant american silkworm hyalophora cecropia , introducing carbon dioxide as a surgical anesthetic . he showed that a hormone from the brain activated the prothoracic glands to release the moulting hormone ecdysone . when the juvenile hormone is present also , larvae moult to another larval stage . juvenile hormone is not present during the larval-to-pupal or the pupal-to-adult moults . the pupae enter diapause which is broken when the brain has been chilled for weeks , after which it releases the brain hormone . williams was the first to isolate juvenile hormone and ecdysone . with his students he studied cocoon-spinning behavior and the profound metabolic shutdown during diapause , and was the first to discover and isolate cocoonase and cytochrome b5 , as well as the `` paper factor '' . he subsequently proposed that hormonal analogues could be used as pesticides by disrupting the developmental cycles of insects.williams was the chairman of the biology department at harvard university from <year> to <year> , and the benjamin bussey professor of biology from <year> until his retirement in <year> . he was a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences , and was elected to the national academy of sciences , where he was a member of the academy 's council for two terms and chairman of biological sciences for one . he was also a

to be known , helped the money-losing company reform its chaotic administration through modern planning , organization , and management control systems . because of their youth , combined with asking many questions , ford employees initially and disparagingly referred to them as the `` quiz kids '' . the quiz kids rebranded themselves as the `` whiz kids '' . starting as manager of planning and financial analysis , mcnamara advanced rapidly through a series of top-level management positions . mcnamara had ford adopt computers to construct models to find the most efficient , rational means of production , which led to much rationalization . mcnamara 's style of `` scientific management '' with his use of computer spreadsheets featuring graphs showing trends in the auto industry were regarded as extremely innovative in the 1950s and were much copied by other executives in the following decades . in his <year> memoirs , mcnamara wrote : `` i had spent fifteen years as a manager [ at ford ] identifying problems and forcing organizations—often against their will—to think deeply and realistically about alternative courses of action and their consequences '' . he was a force behind the ford falcon sedan , introduced in the fall of 1959—a small , simple and inexpensive-to-produce counter to the large , expensive vehicles prominent in the late 1950s . mcnamara placed a high emphasis on safety : the lifeguard options package introduced the seat belt ( a novelty at the time ) and a dished steering wheel , which helped to prevent the driver from being impaled on the steering column during a collision.after the lincoln line 's very large <year> , <year> , and <year> models proved unpopular , mcnamara pushed for smaller versions , such as the <year> lincoln continental . on november <days> , <year> , mcnamara became the first president of ford motor company from outside the ford family since john s. gray in <year> . == secretary of defense == after his election in <year> , president-elect john f. kennedy first offered the post of secretary of defense to robert a. lovett , who had already served in that position in the truman administration ; lovett declined but recommended mcnamara . kennedy had read about mcnamara and his career in a time magazine article on december <days> , <year> , and interviewed him on december <days> , with his brother and right-hand man robert f. kennedy also being present . mcnamara told kennedy that he did n't know anything about government , to which kennedy replied : `` we can learn our jobs together . i do n't know how to be president either '' . mcnamara had read kennedy 's ghostwritten book profiles in courage and asked him if he had really written it himself , with kennedy insisting that he did . mcnamara 's confidence and self-assurance impressed kennedy . kennedy offered mcnamara the chance to be either secretary of defense or secretary of the treasury ; mcnamara came back a week later , accepting the post of secretary of defense on the condition of having the right of final approval in all appointments to the department of defense , with kennedy replying : `` it 's a deal '' . mcnamara 's salary as the ceo of ford ran to some $ <integer> million dollars per year while by contrast the position of the defense secretary paid only $ 25,000 per year . given the financial sacrifices , mcnamara was able to insist to kennedy that he have the right to appoint his officials and run the pentagon his own way . according to special counsel ted sorensen , kennedy regarded mcnamara as the `` star of his team , calling upon him for advice on a wide range of issues beyond national security , including business and economic matters . '' mcnamara became one of the few members of the kennedy administration to work and socialize with kennedy , and he became close to attorney general robert f. kennedy , eventually serving as a pallbearer at the younger kennedy 's funeral in <year> . initially , the basic policies outlined by president kennedy in a message to congress on march <days> , <year> , guided mcnamara in the reorientation of the defense program . kennedy rejected the concept of first-strike attack and emphasized the need for adequate strategic arms and defense to deter nuclear attack on the united states and its allies . u.s. arms , he maintained , must constantly be under civilian command and control , and the nation 's defense posture had to be `` designed to reduce the danger of irrational or unpremeditated general war . '' the primary mission of u.s. overseas forces , in cooperation with its allies , was `` to prevent the steady erosion of the free world through limited wars '' . kennedy and mcnamara rejected massive retaliation for a posture of flexible response . the u.s. wanted choices in an emergency other than `` inglorious retreat or unlimited retaliation '' , as the president put it . out of a major review of the military challenges confronting the u.s. initiated by mcnamara in <year> came a decision to increase the nation 's `` limited warfare '' capabilities . these moves were significant because mcnamara was abandoning president dwight d. eisenhower 's policy of massive retaliation in favor of a flexible response strategy that relied on increased u.s. capacity to conduct limited , non-nuclear warfare . the kennedy administration placed particular emphasis on improving the ability to counter communist `` wars of national liberation '' , in which the enemy avoided head-on military confrontation and resorted to political subversion and guerrilla tactics . as mcnamara said in his <year> annual report , `` the military tactics are those of the sniper , the ambush , and the raid . the political tactics are terror , extortion , and assassination . '' in practical terms , this meant training and equipping u.s. military personnel , as well as allies such as south vietnam , for counterinsurgency operations . during the cuban missile crisis <days> october <year> , mcnamara served as a member of excomm and played a large role in the administration 's handling and eventual defusing of the cuban missile crisis . he was a strong proponent of the blockade option over a missile strike and helped persuade the joint chiefs of staff to agree with the blockade option . increased attention to conventional strength complemented these special forces preparations . in this instance , he called up reserves and also proceeded to expand the regular armed forces . whereas active duty strength had declined from approximately 3,555,000 to 2,483,000 between <year> ( the end of the korean war ) and <year> , it increased to nearly 2,808,000 by june <days> , <year> . then the forces leveled off at around 2,700,000 until the vietnam military buildup began in <year> , reaching a peak of nearly 3,550,000 by <other> , just after mcnamara left office . kennedy , who was fascinated with counterinsurgency warfare , made a major push to develop the special forces , popularly known as the green berets . the u.s. army leadership was , for the most part , strongly opposed to the counterinsurgency vogue , and stoutly resisted the presidential pressure for more counterinsurgency training and forces . the u.s. army , for reasons of bureaucratic politics , budgetary reasons and sheer pride , wanted to be equipped to fight a conventional war in central europe against the soviet army , with a large number of divisions armed with expensive hi-tech weapons designed for maximum firepower , instead of having small teams of special forces armed with relatively low tech weapons like assault rifles fight in a third world country . === nuclear strategy , the triad doctrine === when mcnamara took over the pentagon in <year> , the united states military relied on an all-out nuclear strike to respond to a soviet attack of any kind , which would kill soviet military forces and civilians . this was the same nuclear strategy planned by the strategic air command ( sac ) , led by general curtis lemay . mcnamara did not agree with this approach . he sought other options after seeing that this strategy could not guarantee the destruction of all soviet nuclear weapons , thus leaving the united states vulnerable to retaliation . mcnamara 's alternative in the doctrine of counterforce was to try to limit the united states nuclear exchange by targeting only enemy military forces . this would prevent retaliation and escalation by holding soviet cities hostage to a follow-up strike . mcnamara later concluded that counterforce was not likely to control escalation but to provoke retaliation . the u.s. nuclear policy remained the same . === other steps === mcnamara took other steps to increase u.s. deterrence posture and military capabilities . he raised the proportion of strategic air command ( sac ) strategic bombers on <other> ground alert from <integer> % to <integer> % , thus lessening their vulnerability to missile attack . <days> december <year> , he established the united states strike command ( stricom ) . authorized to draw forces when needed from the strategic army corps ( strac ) , the tactical air command , and the airlift units of the military air transport service and the military services , strike command had the mission `` to respond swiftly and with whatever force necessary to threats against the peace in any part of the world , reinforcing unified commands or ... carrying out separate contingency operations . '' mcnamara also increased long-range airlift and sealift capabilities and funds for space research and development . after reviewing the separate and often uncoordinated service efforts in intelligence and communications , mcnamara in <year> consolidated these functions in the defense intelligence agency and the defense communications agency ( the latter originally established by sod robert gates in <year> ) , having both report to the secretary of defense through the jcs . the end effect was to remove the intelligence function from the control of the military and to put it under the control of the secretary of defense . in the same year , he set up the defense supply agency to work toward unified supply procurement , distribution , and inventory management under the control of the secretary of defense rather than the uniformed military . mcnamara 's institution of systems analysis as a basis for making key decisions on force requirements , weapon systems , and other matters occasioned much debate . two of its main practitioners during the mcnamara era , alain c. enthoven and k. wayne smith , described the concept as follows : `` first , the word 'systems ' indicates that every decision should be considered in as broad a context as necessary ... the word 'analysis ' emphasizes the need to reduce a complex problem to its component parts for better understanding . systems analysis takes a complex problem and sorts out the tangle of significant factors so that each can be studied by the method most appropriate to it . '' enthoven and smith said they used mainly civilians as systems analysts because they could apply independent points of view to force planning . mcnamara 's tendency to take military advice into less account than had previous secretaries and to override military opinions contributed to his unpopularity with service leaders . it was also generally thought that systems analysis , rather than being objective , was tailored by the civilians to support decisions that mcnamara had already made . the most notable example of systems analysis was the planning , programming and budgeting system ( ppbs ) instituted by united states department of defense comptroller charles j. hitch . mcnamara directed hitch to analyze defense requirements systematically and produce a long-term , program-oriented defense budget . ppbs evolved to become the heart of the mcnamara management program . according to enthoven and smith , the basic ideas of ppbs were : `` the attempt to put defense program issues into a broader context and to search for explicit measures of national need and adequacy '' ; `` consideration of military needs and costs together '' ; `` explicit consideration of alternatives at the top decision level '' ; `` the active use of an analytical staff at the top policymaking levels '' ; `` a plan combining both forces and costs which projected into the future the foreseeable implications of current decisions '' ; and `` open and explicit analysis , that is , each analysis should be made available to all interested parties , so that they can examine the calculations , data , and assumptions and retrace the steps leading to the conclusions . '' in practice , the data produced by the analysis was so large and so complex that while it was available to all interested parties , none of them could challenge the conclusions.among the management tools developed to implement ppbs were the five year defense plan ( fydp ) , the draft presidential memorandum ( dpm ) , the readiness , information and control tables , and the development concept paper ( dcp ) . the annual fydp was a series of tables projecting forces for eight years and costs and manpower for five years in mission-oriented , rather than individual service , programs . by <year> , the fydp covered ten military areas : strategic forces , general-purpose forces , intelligence and communications , airlift and sealift , guard and reserve forces , research and development , central supply and maintenance , training and medical services , administration and related activities , and support of other nations . the draft presidential memorandum ( dpm ) —intended for the white house and usually prepared by the systems analysis office—was a method to study and analyze major defense issues . sixteen dpms appeared between <year> and <year> on such topics as strategic offensive and defensive forces , nato strategy and force structure , military assistance , and tactical air forces . osd sent the dpms to the services and the joint chief of staff ( jcs ) for comment ; in making decisions , mcnamara included in the dpm a statement of alternative approaches , force levels , and other factors . the dpm in its final form became a decision document . the dpm was hated by the jcs and uniformed military in that it cut their ability to communicate directly to the white house . the dpms were also disliked because the systems analysis process was so heavyweight that it was impossible for any service to effectively challenge its conclusions.the development concept paper examined performance , schedule , cost estimates , and technical risks to provide a basis for determining whether to begin or continue a research and development program . but in practice , what it proved to be was a cost burden that became a barrier to entry for companies attempting to deal with the military . it aided the trend toward a few large non-competitive defense contractors serving the military . rather than serving any useful purpose , the overhead necessary to generate information that was often in practice ignored resulted in increased costs throughout the system.the readiness , information , and control tables provided data on specific projects , more detailed than in the fydp , such as the tables for the southeast asia deployment plan , which recorded by month and quarter the schedule for deployment , consumption rates , and future projections of u.s. forces in southeast asia . === cuban missile crisis === the cuban missile crisis was between the united states and the soviet union lasting for <integer> days <days> october <year> . during this time , robert mcnamara was serving as secretary of defense and one of john f. kennedy 's trusted advisors . when kennedy received confirmation of the placement of offensive soviet missiles in cuba , he immediately set up 'executive committee ' , referred to as 'excomm ' . this committee included united states government officials , including robert mcnamara , to advise kennedy on the crisis . kennedy instructed excomm to immediately come up with a response to the soviet threat unanimously without him present . the joint chiefs of staff favored launching air strikes against the soviet missile sites in cuba , an opinion that mcnamara did not hold and advised kennedy against the chiefs , warning that air strikes would almost certainly be crossing the rubicon . mcnamara 's relations with the hawkish joint chiefs of staff had been strained during the crisis , and his relations with admiral george anderson and general curtis lemay were especially testy . both admiral anderson and general lemay had favored invading cuba , welcomed the prospect of a war with soviet union under the grounds that a war with the soviet union was inevitable , and whose attitudes towards kennedy and mcnamara had verged on insubordination . admiral anderson had at a one point ordered mcnamara out of the naval operations room , saying that as a civilian he was unqualified to be making decisions about naval matters , leading mcnamara to say that he was the defense secretary and anderson was unqualified to be ordering him to do anything . during this time it was confirmed the crisis had to be resolved within <integer> hours by receiving two messages from nikita khrushchev . the first message , an informal one , stated if the united states guaranteed to not invade cuba then they would take the missiles out . the second message , a more formal one , was broadcast on the radio stating if the united states attacked then cuba was prepared to retaliate with masses of military power . although american defense planning focused on using nuclear weapons , kennedy and mcnamara saw it was clear the use of strategic weapons could be suicidal . on tuesday october <days> , excomm had their first meeting . the majority of officials favored an air attack on cuba in hopes to destroy the missile sites , although the vote was not unanimous which brought them to other alternatives . by the end of the week , excomm came up with four different alternative strategies to present to the president : a blockade , an air strike , an invasion , or some combination of these . these actions are known as oplan <integer> , oplan <integer> and oplan <integer> . a quarantine was a way to prevent the soviets from bringing any military equipment in or out of cuba . during the final review of both alternatives on sunday , october <days> , upon kennedy 's request , mcnamara presented the argument against the attack and for the quarantine . on wednesday , october <days> at <other> a.m. edt , the quarantine line around cuba went into effect . following cuba 's aftermath , mcnamara stated , `` there is no such thing as strategy , only crisis management . `` after the crisis mcnamara recommended to kennedy that admiral anderson and general lemay be sacked . however , kennedy was afraid of a congressional backlash if he sacked two of the chiefs at once . moreover , kennedy did not wish for his disagreements with the joint chiefs to become public and felt that sacking two of the chiefs at once would lead to speculation in the media about such a disagreement . kennedy told mcnamara : `` all right , you can fire one . which one will it be ? '' without hesitation , mcnamara answered `` anderson '' . later on in <year> , a white house release announced that admiral anderson was the new american ambassador to portugal . === cost reductions === mcnamara 's staff stressed systems analysis as an aid in decision making on weapon development and many other budget issues . the secretary believed that the united states could afford any amount needed for national security , but that `` this ability does not excuse us from applying strict standards of effectiveness and efficiency to the way we spend our defense dollars .... you have to make a judgment on how much is enough . '' acting on these principles , mcnamara instituted a much-publicized cost reduction program , which , he reported , saved $ <integer> billion in the five-year period beginning in <year> . although he had to withstand a storm of criticism from senators and representatives from affected congressional districts , he closed many military bases and installations that he judged unnecessary for national security . he was equally determined about other cost-saving measures.due to the nuclear arms race , the vietnam war buildup and other projects , total obligational authority ( toa ) increased greatly during the mcnamara years . fiscal year toa increased from $ 48.4 billion in <year> ( equal to $ <integer> billion in <year> ) to $ 49.5 ( $ <integer> ) billion in <year> ( before the major vietnam increases ) to $ 74.9 ( $ <integer> ) billion in <year> , mcnamara 's last year in office ( though he left office in february <days> . not until fy <year> did dod 's total obligational authority surpass that of fy <year> in constant dollars . ==== program consolidation ==== one major hallmark of mcnamara 's cost reductions was the consolidation of programs from different services , most visibly in aircraft acquisition , believing that the redundancy created waste and unnecessary spending . mcnamara directed the air force to adopt the navy 's <other> phantom and <other> corsair combat aircraft , a consolidation that was quite successful . conversely , his actions in mandating a premature across-the-board adoption of the untested m16 rifle proved catastrophic when the weapons began to fail in combat , though later congressional investigations revealed the causes of these failures as negligence and borderline sabotage on behalf of the army ordnance corps ' officers . mcnamara tried to extend his success by merging development programs as well , resulting in the tfx dual service project to combine navy requirements for a fleet air defense ( fad ) aircraft and air force requirements for a tactical bomber . his experience in the corporate world led him to believe that adopting a single type for different missions and service would save money . he insisted on the general dynamics entry over the dod 's preference for boeing because of commonality issues . though heralded as a fighter that could do everything ( fast supersonic dash , slow carrier and short airfield landings , tactical strike and even close air support ) , in the end it involved too many compromises to succeed at any of them . the navy version was drastically overweight and difficult to land , and eventually canceled after a grumman study showed it was incapable of matching the abilities of the newly revealed soviet <other> and <other> aircraft . the <other> would eventually find its niche as a tactical bomber and electronic warfare aircraft with the air force.however , many analysts believe that even though the tfx project itself was a failure , mcnamara was ahead of his time as the trend in fighter design has continued toward consolidation — the <other> falcon and <other> hornet emerged as multi-role fighters , and most modern designs combine many of the roles the tfx would have had . in many ways , the joint strike fighter is seen as a rebirth of the tfx project , in that it purports to satisfy the needs of three american air arms ( as well as several foreign customers ) , fulfilling the roles of strike fighter , carrier-launched fighter , v/stol , and close air support ( and drawing many criticisms similar to those leveled against the tfx ) . === vietnam war === ==== into vietnam ==== during president john f. kennedy 's term , while mcnamara was secretary of defense , america 's troops in south vietnam increased from <integer> to 16,000 advisers , who were not supposed to engage in combat but rather to train the army of the republic of vietnam ( arvn ) .the truman and eisenhower administrations had committed the united states to support the french and native anti-communist forces in vietnam in resisting efforts by the communists in the north to unify the country , though neither administration established actual combat forces in the war . the u.s. role—initially limited to financial support , military advice and covert intelligence gathering—expanded after <year> when the french withdrew . during the kennedy administration , the u.s. military advisory group in south vietnam steadily increased , with mcnamara 's concurrence , from <integer> to 16,000 . u.s. involvement escalated after the gulf of tonkin incidents <days> august <year> , involving two purported attacks on a u.s. navy destroyer by north vietnamese naval vessels.in the kennedy administration , mcnamara was closely allied in debates in the cabinet with dean rusk , the secretary of state , with both favoring greater american support for south vietnam . initially , the main concern of the new kennedy administration was laos , not south vietnam . <days> february <year> , mcnamara spoke in favor of intervention in laos , saying that six <other> planes owed by the central intelligence agency could be fitted to carry <other> bombs in support of general phoumi nosavan 's forces . rusk shot down that proposal , saying his world war two experiences in burma had taught him that bombing was ineffective in the jungles and six planes were not enough . in the spring of <year> kennedy seriously considered intervening in laos where the communist pathet lao , supported by north vietnam , were winning the civil war . at one point , the joint chiefs of staff advised sending <integer> , <integer> u.s. troops into laos . however , laos was a backward , landlocked country with barely any modern roads and only two modern airfields , both of which were quite small by western standards , which would have made for a logistical nightmare . furthermore , memories of the korean war were still fresh , and it was generally accepted if the united states sent in troops into laos , it was almost certain that china would do likewise , thus leading to another sino-american war . the southeast asia treaty organization ( seato ) was split with its european members such as france and britain stoutly opposed to intervention in laos while its asian members such as thailand and the philippines were all for intervention in laos . mcnamara noted to kennedy it was quite possible that the two airfields in laos could be seized by the communist forces , which would cut off any u.s forces in laos , thus turning the intervention into a debacle . at a meeting on <integer> april <year> , when questioned by the attorney-general , robert f. kennedy , mcnamara stated that `` we should take a stand in thailand and south vietnam '' , pointedly omitting laos from the nations in southeast asia to risk a war over.mcnamara soon changed his mind about laos . on <integer> may <year> , he advised president kennedy to send in ground troops into laos , saying `` we must be prepared to win '' , and advising using nuclear weapons if china should intervene . on <integer> may <days> mcnamara , using more stronger language , told kennedy that the united states should definitely intervene in laos , even through he was very certain that it would lead to chinese intervention , concluding that `` at some point , <days> may have to initiate the use of nuclear weapons to prevent the defeat of our forces '' . kennedy , who was distrustful of the hawkish advice given by the joint chiefs of staff after the failure of the bay of pigs invasion , instead decided to seek a diplomatic solution to the laos crisis at a peace conference in geneva in <other> that ultimately led to an agreement to make laos neutral in the cold war . the problems posed by the possibility of a war with china and the logistical problems of supporting a large units of troops in laos led mcnamara ultimately favor an alternative strategy of having a small number of u.s army special forces operate in laos working with american allies such as the hmong hill tribes . on <integer> september <year> , the joint chiefs of staff estimated to mcnamara that if chinese forces entered laos , then the seato forces would need at least <integer> divisions consisting of some <integer> , <integer> men to stop them . at the same time , the joint chiefs also estimated that the two airfields in laos were capable of landing some <integer> , <integer> troops a day each , which would give the advantage to the chinese . such dire assessments led kennedy to ignore mcnamara and the joint chiefs , and to favor a diplomatic solution the laos crisis.in october <year> , when general maxwell taylor and walt whitman rostow advised sending 8,000 american combat troops to south vietnam , mcnamara rejected that recommendation as inadequate , stating that 8,000 troops would `` probably not tip the scales decisively '' , instead recommending to kennedy that he send <integer> divisions to south vietnam . kennedy rejected that advice . <days> may <year> , mcnamara paid his first visit to south vietnam , where he told the press `` every quantitative measurement ... shows that we are winning the war '' . led by general paul d. harkins , the officers of the military assistance command , vietnam altered a map that showed too much of south vietnam under viet cong control , and massaged the statistics to make the viet cong appear weaker than what they were . mcnamara 's `` quantitative '' style based upon much number-crunching by computers about trends in vietnam missed the human dimension . aspects of the war such popular views and attitudes in south vietnam , and that the south vietnamese president ngô đình diệm favored a `` divide and rule '' strategy of having multiple government departments compete against one another as a way of staying in power were missed by mcnamara 's `` quantitative '' approach as there was no way that computers could calculate these aspects of the war . though mcnamara had supported plans to intervene in laos in <year> , by <year> he had changed his mind . during a discussion with general lyman lemnitzer , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , mcnamara had stumped him by asking him what the united states would do in the event of several scenarios in laos , none of which lemnitzer and the chiefs were capable of answering . the inability of the joint chiefs to answer mcnamara 's questions about what the united states should do if north vietnam should stage a major offensive down the mekong river valley from laos into cambodia and finally south vietnam persuaded mcnamara that the joint chiefs had no vision of the issues , and were merely advocating intervention in laos to avoid looking weak.in <year> , mcnamara supported a plan for mass spraying of the rice fields with herbicides in the phu yen mountains to starve the viet cong out , a plan that was only stopped when w. averell harriman pointed out to kennedy that the ensuing famine would kill thousands of innocent people . in late <year> , mcnamara ordered planning to withdraw the american advisers from south vietnam in <year> as according to pentagon calculations the war should be won by then . at the time , mcnamara told kennedy : `` there is a new feeling of confidence that victory is possible '' .on <integer> january <year> , mcnamara 's rosy projections and assumptions based upon what his computers had told him about vietnam were rudely shattered by the battle of ap bac , that began when three viet cong ( vc ) companies were encircled by the arvn 's 7th division in the village of ap bac . despite being outnumbered by a factor of <other> and being outgunned having only rifles compared to the 7th division ’ s tanks , artillery , armored personnel carriers and helicopters , the vc defeated the 7th division in the ensuing battle and escaped into the jungle . colonel john paul vann , the american adviser attached to the 7th division summed up the battle in a report in his usual earthy language as : `` a miserable fucking performance , just like what it always is '' . vann , a colorful figure whose outspokenly blunt criticism of how the war was being fought made him a favorite of the media , was much disliked by mcnamara , who did not appreciate the criticism as he continued to insist that the war was being won.vann 's reports criticizing diệm 's regime as corrupt and incompetent were most unwelcome to mcnamara who contended that the reforms advocated by vann were unnecessary . <days> march <year> , vann resigned from the army as he was informed that his career was over . after the battle of ap bac , a debate began in the kennedy cabinet about the viability of the diệm regime , which was reinforced by the buddhist crisis , which began <days> may <year> . when the subject of supporting a coup against diệm was first raised by kennedy at a national security council meeting <days> august <year> , mcnamara spoke in favor of retaining diệm . on <integer> august <year> , paul kattenburg , a diplomat newly returned from saigon suggested at a meeting attend by rusk , mcnamara and vice president johnson that the united states should end support for diem and leave south vietnam to its fate . mcnamara was stoutly opposed to kattenburg 's suggestion , saying `` we have been winning the war '' .unable to gain a consensus about what to do , <days> september <year> , kennedy sent mcnamara and general taylor on a `` fact-finding mission '' to south vietnam . at a meeting in the gia long palace , president diem showed mcnamara various graphs and charts that purported to be proof that the war was being won , a performance that convinced mcnamara the war was as good as won . kennedy wanted a negative assessment of diệm to justify supporting a coup , but mcnamara and taylor instead wrote about the `` great progress '' achieved by diệm and confidently predicted that the `` bulk '' of the american advisers would leave in <year> as by that point they predicted the vc insurgency would be crushed . mcnamara predicted that if diệm continued his policies , that by <year> the insurgency would be `` little more than organized banditry '' . with the cia and the ambassador henry cabot lodge jr. urging support for a coup while the pentagon was opposed , kennedy vacillated and finally being unable to make up his mind , gave the power of decision to lodge . lodge , who detested diệm , gave his approval to the generals plotting against him.on <integer> november <year> , the coup was launched . after the presidential palace was overrun in the fighting , diệm was captured trying to flee saigon and executed on <integer> november <year> . the new government in saigon was headed by general dương văn minh . on <integer> november <year> , kennedy was assassinated and succeeded by lyndon johnson . <days> december <year> , johnson sent mcnamara on another `` fact-finding mission '' to south vietnam to assess general minh 's performance . on <integer> december <year> , mcnamara reported the situation was `` very disturbing '' as the `` current trends , unless reversed in the next two or three months , will lead to neutralization at best or more likely to a communist-controlled state '' . he also admitted that the computer models and statistics , which he had attached such importance to , were `` grossly in error '' and that government control of rural areas had `` in fact been deteriorating ... to a far greater extent than we realized '' since july <days> regarding minh 's regime mcnamara wrote at present `` there is no organized government in south vietnam '' . through mcnamara admitted that the new regime was `` indecisive and drifting '' , he advised johnson to undertake `` more forceful moves if the situation does not show early signs of improvement '' . on <integer> january <year> , general minh was overthrown in a bloodless coup d'état by general nguyễn khánh . the change in leadership did not affect the war . lyman kirkpatrick of the cia reported <days> february <year> after visiting saigon that he was `` shocked by the number of our people and of the military , even those whose job is always to say we are winning , who feel the tide is against us '' . the same month saw a vc battalion in the mekong delta escape from a larger force of south vietnamese troops , who had been rated as some of the very best in the arvn by the american advisers who had trained them , a battle that underscored the problems in the arvn.on <integer> march <year> , mcnamara visited south vietnam to report to president johnson about how well the new regime of khánh was handling the war . upon landing in saigon , mcnamara told the press : `` we shall stay for as long it takes to ... win the battle against the communist insurgents '' . during his visit , mcnamara spoke memorized phrases in mangled vietnamese ( mcnamara kept forgetting that vietnamese is a tonal language ) in speeches praising khánh as south vietnam 's `` best possible leader '' . mcnamara always ended his speeches by shouting out what he thought was a phrase meaning `` long live a free vietnam ! `` , but as he used the wrong tones , instead he said `` vietnam , go to sleep ! '' mcnamara pressed khánh to put south vietnam on a war footing by conscripting all able-bodied young men into the military , which he promised he would do . khánh did not keep his promise as wealthy and middle class south vietnamese families objected to having their sons conscripted , and as a result the burden of conscription called by khánh 's national service law fell only on sons of poor families , provoking much resentment . after returning to washington on <integer> march <days> mcnamara reported to johnson that the situation had `` unquestionably been growing worse '' since his last visit <days> december <year> with <integer> % of the countryside now under `` vietcong control or predominant influence '' ; most of the south vietnamese people were displaying `` apathy and indifference '' ; the desertion rate in the arvn was `` high and increasing '' while the vc were `` recruiting energetically '' . the `` greatest weakness '' accordingly to mcnamara was the `` uncertain viability '' of khánh 's government , which might be overthrown at any moment as the arvn was ridden with factionalism and intrigue.to save south vietnam , mcnamara recommended that the united states make it `` emphatically clear '' its willingness to support khánh to the hilt . other recommendations , which were accepted in a national security council `` action memorandum '' called for the united states to pay for an increase in the arvn , provide the republic of vietnam air force with more planes and helicopters , and for the united states to pay for more civil servants to administer rural south vietnam . more importantly , the `` action memorandum '' redefined the vietnam war as not only important for asia , but for the entire world as the document asserted the global credibility of the united states was now at stake as it was claimed america 's allies would lose faith in american promises if the south vietnamese government were overthrown . the `` action memorandum '' argued that to `` lose '' south vietnam would fatally weaken american global leadership , making the war a `` test case '' of american willingness to continue as a global power.in april <year> , senator wayne morse called the war `` mcnamara 's war '' . in response , mcnamara told the press that he was honored , saying `` i think it is a very important war , and i am pleased to be identified with it and do whatever i can to win it '' . <days> may <year> , senator richard russell advised johnson against relying too much on mcnamara , saying `` mcnamara is the smartest fella any of us know . but he 's got too much-he 's opinionated as hell-and he 's made up his mind '' . russell told johnson that he should find an expert , preferably a world war two general who was `` not scared to death of mcnamara '' to go to south vietnam to say that the war was unwinnable and that the united states should pull out , advice that johnson rejected.although south vietnam by <year> was receiving a sum of american economic and military aid that ran to $ <integer> million per day , the south vietnamese state was falling apart with corruption reaching such a point that most south vietnamese civil servants and soldiers were not being paid while the projects for `` rural pacification '' that the united states had paid for had collapsed as the money had instead been stolen . the advice that mcnamara and other american officials gave to the south vietnamese to make reforms to crack down on corruption and make the government more effective was always ignored as by this point the south vietnamese government knew very well that the americans , having repeatedly promised in public that they would never permit the `` loss '' of south vietnam , were now prisoners of their own rhetoric . the threats to withhold aid were bluffs , which the south vietnamese exposed by simply ignoring the american advice , leading to a situation whereby stanley karnow , the vietnam correspondent for the time noted : '' ... america lacked leverage ... for the south vietnamese knew that the united states could not abandon them without damaging its own prestige . so despite their reliance on american aid , now more than a half-billion dollars a year , they could safely defy american dictates . in short , their weakness was their strength '' . one south vietnamese minister told karnow at the time : `` our big advantage over the americans is that they want to win the war more than we do '' . to compensate for the weaknesses of the south vietnamese state , by late winter of <year> , senior officials in the johnson administration such as mcnamara 's deputy , william bundy , the assistant secretary of defense , were advocating american intervention in the war . such intervention presented a constitutional problem : to intervene on the scale envisioned would mean waging war , and only congress had the legal power to declare war . fearful of causing a war with china , johnson was opposed to the plans of khánh to invade north vietnam , and he was even less enthusiastic about having the united states invade north vietnam . to declare war on north vietnam would lead to irresistible political pressure at home to invade north vietnam . as such , the solution was floated for congress to pass a resolution granting johnson the power to wage war in vietnam.by <year> , the u.s. navy sent destroyers into the gulf of tonkin to support raids by south vietnamese commandos on north vietnam and to gather intelligence . on <integer> august <year> , one destroyer , the uss maddox was involved in a naval skirmish with north vietnamese vietnam people 's navy torpedo boats within north vietnamese waters . on <integer> august <year> , the maddox and another destroyer , the uss turner joy , initially claimed to have been attacked by the north vietnamese torpedo boats in international waters on a stormy night , but shortly afterward reported there was probably no attack . captain john j. herrick of the maddox reported that the `` torpedo boats '' were almost certainly just radar `` blips '' caused by the `` freak weather effects '' of the storm and the reports of an attack on his ship were due to an `` overeager '' radar operator who mistook the motors of the ship for the rush of torpedoes . johnson promptly seized upon the reports of an attack on a navy warship in international waters to ask congress to pass a resolution giving him the authority to wage war in vietnam . mcnamara , via admiral u. s. grant sharp jr. of the pacific fleet , put strong pressure on herrick to say that his ship had been attacked by torpedo boats , despite his strong doubts on the subject . on <integer> august <year> , mcnamara appeared before congress to present proof of what he claimed was an attack on the navy 's warships in international waters of the gulf of tonkin and stated it was imperative that congress pass the resolution as quickly as possible . records from the lyndon johnson library have indicated that mcnamara may have misled johnson on the purported attack on a u.s. navy destroyer by allegedly withholding recommendations from us pacific commanders against executing airstrikes . mcnamara was also instrumental in presenting the event to congress and the public as justification for escalation of the war against the communists . in <year> , mcnamara met with former north vietnam defense minister võ nguyên giáp , who told his american counterpart that the august <days> attack never happened , a conclusion mcnamara eventually came to accept.president johnson ordered operation pierce arrow , retaliatory air strikes on north vietnamese naval bases . congress approved , with only senators wayne morse ( d-or ) , and ernest gruening ( d-ak ) , voting against , the gulf of tonkin resolution , authorizing the president `` to take all necessary measures to repel any armed attack against the forces of the u.s. and to prevent further aggression . '' regardless of the particulars of the incident , the larger issue would turn out to be the sweeping powers granted by the resolution . it gave johnson virtually unfettered authority to expand retaliation for a relatively minor naval incident into a major land war involving 500,000 american soldiers . `` the fundamental issue of tonkin gulf involved not deception but , rather , misuse of power bestowed by the resolution , '' mcnamara wrote later . though johnson now had the authority to wage war , he proved reluctant to use it , for example by ignoring the advice of the joint chiefs of staff to bomb north vietnam after a vc attack on bien hoa air base killed five americans and destroyed <integer> <other> bombers . knowing of johnson 's hesitance , on <integer> december <year> mcnamara recommended a `` graduated '' response program , urging johnson to launch operation barrel roll , a bombing offensive against the part of the ho chi minh trail in the southern part of neutral laos , which was approved by the president . on christmas eve <year> , the vc bombed the brinks hotel in saigon , killing two americans . despite mcnamara 's recommendations to bomb north vietnam , johnson still hesitated . ==== mcnamara at war ==== in <year> , in response to stepped-up military activity by the vc in south vietnam and their north vietnamese allies , the u.s. began bombing north vietnam , deployed large military forces and entered into combat in south vietnam . mcnamara 's plan , supported by requests from top u.s. military commanders in vietnam , led to the commitment of 485,000 troops by the end of <year> and almost 535,000 by june <days> , <year> . <days> january <year> , mcnamara together with the national security adviser mcgeorge bundy co-wrote a memo to president johnson stating `` both of us are now pretty well convinced that our present policy can lead only to disastrous defeat '' as it was hopeless to expect the unstable and corrupt south vietnamese government to defeat the vc who were steadily `` gaining in the countryside '' . bundy and mcnamara wrote `` the time for has come for hard choices '' as the united states now had the alternatives of either negotiating with north vietnam to `` salvage what little can be preserved '' or to resort to intervention to `` force a change '' . both bundy and mcnamara stated that they favored the latter , arguing that the commitment of u.s troops to fight in south vietnam and a strategic bombing campaign against north vietnam were now required . mcnamara 's hawkish stance on vietnam was well known in washington and many in the press often referred to the war as `` mcnamara 's war '' as he was the one in the cabinet always pressing for greater american involvement.in february <year> , the vc attacked the american airfield at pleiku , killing <integer> americans and destroying <integer> aircraft . after hearing of the attack , johnson assembled his national security team together with the speaker of the house of representatives , john w. mccormack , and the senate majority leader , mike mansfield , to announce `` i 've had enough of this '' . only mansfield and the vice president , hubert humphrey , objected to johnson 's plans to bomb north vietnam . aircraft from the carrier , uss ranger , launched operation flaming dart bombing the north vietnamese army base at đồng hới later that day . mcnamara was forced to tell johnson that the flaming dart raids had done little damage owning to the heavy clouds , which caused the pilots to miss when dropping their bombs , and more raids would be needed . on <integer> february <days> johnson ordered more bombing raids , and <integer> march approved operation rolling thunder , a strategic bombing offensive against north vietnam that was originally planned to last eight weeks , and instead went on for three years . after the bombing raids started , general william westmoreland of the military assistance command , vietnam ( macv ) , cabled johnson to say that da nang air base was vulnerable as he had no faith in the ability of the south vietnamese to protect it , leading him to ask for american troops to be deployed instead . on <integer> march <year> , two battalions from the united states marine corps were landed at danang , making the beginning of the ground war for the united states . on <integer> april <days> mcnamara urged johnson to send 40,000 troops to vietnam , advice that was accepted.by june <year> , westmoreland was reporting that south vietnam was faced with a `` collapse '' , which would require 180,000 troops to stop , which would be just a `` stopgap '' , and another 100,000 troops would be needed `` to seize the initiative from the enemy '' . mcnamara 's advice <days> july <year> to johnson was to commit more 180,000 troops to south vietnam together with a stepped up aerial offensive to destroy north vietnam 's economy was called by bundy `` rash to the point of folly '' . bundy stated that for johnson to agree to mcnamara 's request to send more troops `` was a slippery slope toward total u.s. responsibility and corresponding fecklessness on the vietnamese side '' . bundy argued that it was the responsibility of the south vietnamese government to stop the vc and that if the americans continued to do all the fighting , then the united states would lack the necessary leverage to pressure saigon into making reforms , turning `` ... the conflict into a white man 's war , with the united states in the shoes of the french '' . to resolve the debate , later <days> july <year> , mcnamara visited south vietnam on yet another `` fact-finding mission '' for president johnson and met the new south vietnamese premier , air marshal nguyễn cao kỳ , who had just overthrown khánh . air marshal kỳ wore a flamboyant uniform which he had designed himself of a white jacket , black pants , red socks and black shoes which led mcnamara to dub him as looking `` like a saxophone player in a second-rate nightclub '' . mcnamara was not impressed with kỳ , reporting to johnson that he saw little evidence that he was capable of winning the war , and the united states would have to send more troops to south vietnam . upon his return to the united states , mcnamara told the press that the u.s forces in vietnam were inflicting `` increasingly heavy losses '' on the vc , but in private told president johnson that the situation was `` worse than a year ago '' .mcnamara also advised the president that by early <year> he would have to send 100,000 more troops to south vietnam in order to win the war , and he would need to mobilize the reserves and state national guards as well . johnson accepted the first recommendation while rejecting the latter , disregarding bundy 's warnings that to send more troops would paradoxically mean less leverage over south vietnam . to mobilize the reserves and national guards would mean having to call up hundreds of thousands of men from civilian life , which would inevitably disrupt the economy , which in turn would require ending the peacetime economy and putting the economy on a war footing . johnson rejected a wartime economy as imposing too many sacrifices on ordinary americans while threatening his chances for reelection . because the reserves were never called up , the army had to send much of its manpower to vietnam , leaving the u.s divisions in western europe in a `` skeletal '' condition as there was a shortage of volunteers . to make up the shortfall , the army had to rely upon the draft , which caused much domestic opposition , especially as the draft system offered generous exemptions for those attending university and college , leading to the burden of the draft falling disproportionately upon men from poorer families . because of the refusal to call up the reserves , mcnamara had to increase the draft call <days> july <year> from 17,000 per month to 35,000 per month . as most of the <integer> and <other> draftees had a high school diploma or less , this also led to a decline in the army 's intellectual standards , with many officers complaining that most of the draftees were not intelligent enough to be trained for technical duties or promoted up the ranks . throughout the war , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , general earle wheeler , pressed very strongly for the reserves and national guards to be called out , saying the war was steadily ruining the u.s. army . though mcnamara warned the president <days> july <year> that the war would cost an extra $ <integer> billion dollars in defense spending over the next year , johnson at a press conference said his administration would be spending only an extra $ 300–400 million dollars until january <year> . mcnamara warned that the increased spending would spark inflation and raise the deficit , advising johnson to ask congress to increase taxes to forestall those eventualities . johnson responded that congress would not vote for higher taxes , leading mcnamara to argue that the president should at least try , saying `` i would rather fight for what 's right and fail than not try '' . johnson snapped : `` goddammit , bob , that 's what 's wrong with you-you are n't a politician '' .on <integer> november <year> , norman morrison , a quaker burned himself alive in the parking lot of the pentagon to protest the war . all mcnamara saw from his office was the smoke rising from the parking lot , but he was sufficiently troubled by the incident that he refused to discuss it with his family , all the more so because his wife margey was opposed to the war and sympathized with morrison 's feelings , if not his suicide . on <integer> november <year> , mcnamara sent johnson a memo saying that the `` substantial loss of american lives '' in vietnam was worth the sacrifice in order to contain china , which mcnamara called the world 's most dangerous nation . mcnamara wrote that the deployment of troops to south vietnam would `` make sense only if they are in support of a long-term united states policy to contain china '' , writing that the process of `` containing '' china would require `` american attention , money and , from time to time unfortunately lives '' .the casualty lists mounted as the number of troops and the intensity of fighting escalated . mcnamara put in place a statistical strategy for victory in vietnam . he concluded that there were a limited number of vc fighters in south vietnam and that a war of attrition would destroy them . he applied metrics ( body counts ) to determine how close to success his plan was . faced with a guerrilla war , the question of holding territory was irrelevant as the vc never operated for extended periods in areas where the americans were strong and if the americans occupied an area in force , the vc simply moved to other areas where the american presence was weaker . westmoreland had decided , with the support of mcnamara , to defend all of south vietnam , believing that he could win via a strategy of attrition as he would simply inflict enough losses to end the enemy 's ability to wage war . mcnamara devised the `` body count '' measurement to determine how well the americans were doing , reasoning if the americans were inflicting heavy losses as measured by the `` body count '' , it must be a sign that they were winning . general william peers wrote critically of the `` body count '' strategy , stating : `` ... with improper leadership , 'body count ' could create competition between units , particularly if these statistics were compared like baseball standings and there were no stringent requirements as to how and by whom the counts were to be made '' . the obsession with `` body counts '' led to much exaggeration of the losses inflicted on the enemy as the officers with the highest `` body counts '' were promoted while also fueling a grisly competition between units to achieve the highest `` body counts '' that led to innocent civilians being killed to inflate their daily `` body counts '' . it is generally accepted by historians that the vast daily losses that u.s. officers claimed to have inflicted on the vc were fabricated as many officers desperate for a promotion reported `` body counts '' well above what they were actually achieving.the u.s. army sabotaged the efforts of kennedy and mcnamara to develop a more counterinsurgency role by simply declaring that the army 's basic unit , the division , was flexible enough to engage against guerrillas while also promising that the traditional fondness for using maximum firepower would not present a problem as firepower use would be `` discriminating '' . in vietnam , this led to divisions , whose size limited them and their supply trains to the road , using massive amounts of firepower against guerrillas who were often `` nimble '' enough to evade all of the firepower brought to bear . instead , the standard tactics of bringing massive firepower to bear in the form of napalm and artillery strikes against the guerrillas often killed civilians , fueling support for the vc . the special forces did fight in vietnam , but only as an adjutant to the traditional infantry and armored divisions , which did most of the fighting . in a <year> memo , mcnamara admitted that the sort of counterinsurgency war envisioned by kennedy with the special forces leading the fight had not occurred , and wrote that the responsibility for this `` undoubtedly lies with bad management '' on the part of the army . ==== disenchantment ==== up <days> november <year> , mcnamara , who been a supporter of the war , first started to have doubts about the war , saying at a press conference that `` it will be a long war '' , which completely contradicted his previous optimistic statements that the war would be brought to a close soon . although he was a prime architect of the vietnam war and repeatedly overruled the jcs on strategic matters , mcnamara gradually became skeptical about whether the war could be won by deploying more troops to south vietnam and intensifying the bombing of north vietnam , a claim he would publish in a book years later . he also stated later that his support of the war was given out of loyalty to administration policy . he traveled to south vietnam many times to study the situation firsthand and became increasingly reluctant to approve the large force increments requested by the military commanders.as a christmas gesture , johnson ordered a bombing pause over north vietnam and went off to his ranch in texas for the holidays . mcnamara went with his family for skiing in colorado , but upon hearing that the president was open to extending the bombing pause for a few more days , he left his family at the sky lodge in the rockies to fly to the johnson ranch on <integer> december <year> . mcnamara knew that johnson tended to listen to the advice of rusk who saw extending the bombing pause as weakness , and wanted a meeting with johnson without rusk present . mcnamara argued to the president in a three hour long meeting that the north vietnamese would not open peace talks unless the bombing were stopped first , as they kept saying repeatedly , and persuaded johnson to extend the bombing pause into january <days> at a new year 's eve party attended by washington 's elite to welcome <year> , mcnamara expressed doubts about america 's ability to win the war . a week later at a dinner party attended by the economist john kenneth galbraith and johnson 's speechwriter dick goodwin , mcnamara stated that victory was unobtainable , and the best that could be achieved was an `` honorable withdrawal '' that might save south vietnam as a state . <days> february <year> , during the honolulu conference , mcnamara during an `` off-the-record '' chat with a group of journalists spoke about the war in very jaded terms , stating frankly that operation rolling thunder was a failure . mcnamara stated that north vietnam was a backward third world country that did not have the same advanced industrial infrastructure of first world nations , making the bombing offensive useless . mcnamara concluded : `` no amount of bombing can end the war '' . karnow , one of the journalists present during the `` off-the-record '' conversation , described mcnamara 's personality as having changed , noting the defense secretary , who was normally so arrogant and self-assured , convinced he could `` scientifically '' solve any problem , as being subdued and clearly less self-confident.in october <year> , mcnamara returned from yet another visit to south vietnam , full of confidence in public and doubt in private . mcnamara told the media that `` process has exceeded our expectations '' while telling the president he saw `` no reasonable way to bring the war to an end soon '' . though mcnamara reported to johnson that american forces were inflicting heavy losses on the north vietnamese and vc , he added that they could `` more than replace '' their losses and that `` full security exists nowhere '' in south vietnam , even in areas supposedly `` pacified '' by the americans . worst of all , mcnamara complained that the south vietnamese were still not carrying their full share of the load , as they expected the americans to do all the fighting for them , stating : `` this important war must be fought and won by the vietnamese themselves . we have known this from the beginning . but the discouraging truth is that , as was the case in <year> and <year> and <year> , we have not found the formula , the catalyst , for training and inspiring them into effective action '' .in november <year> , mcnamara visited harvard university and the car driving him to see henry kissinger was surrounded by anti-war protesters who forced the automobile to stop . the students refused to let the car move until mcnamara debated their leader , michael ansara , the president of the harvard chapter of students for a democratic society . mcnamara agreed to the debate , and standing on the hood of his car answered the charge from a student in the crowd that the united states was waging aggression by saying the war started in <year> , not <year> , which he knew `` because the international control commission wrote a report that said so . you have n't read it , and if you have , you obviously did n't understand it '' . when the student answered that he had read the international control commission 's report and it did not say that , mcnamara responded he had been a far better university student than his opponent , saying `` i was tougher than you then and i 'm tougher today ! i was more courteous then , and i hope i 'm more courteous today ! '' . as mcnamara continued to insult the crowd and the mood grew more ugly , he fled into quincy house , from which he escaped via underground tunnels to see kissinger . the confrontation with the students had shaken him , and it took half an hour before he was ready to address kissinger 's class.because the effects of operation rolling thunder were more easily measured than with the ground war , mcnamara was especially troubled by the revelation that the bombing offensive had not caused the collapse of north vietnam 's economy as predicted . <days> june <year> , american bombers hit north vietnam 's hydroelectric plants and reduced north vietnam capacity to generate electricity by <integer> % , accordingly to mcnamara 's calculations . at the same time , he also calculated that the annual amount of electricity generated in north vietnam was equal only to a fifth of the electricity generated every year at the potomac electric power company 's plant in alexandria , virginia , making the destruction of north vietnamese power plants meaningless to the outcome of the war as the amount of electricity generated was so small . he also calculated in <year> that over the last two years , american bombers had inflicted damage on north vietnam equal to about $ <integer> million while at the same time , rolling thunder had cost the u.s. air force about <integer> aircraft shot down over north vietnam whose total value was about $ <integer> million , making the bombing campaign uneconomical . mcnamara 's doubts were encouraged by his civilian aides such as leslie h. gelb and john mcnaughton , who complained that their wives and teenage children were chiding them as `` war criminals '' when they came home from work . mcnamara 's own teenage son , robert craig mcnamara , was opposed to the war and denounced his father when he came from work every day . mcnamara was shocked to discover that the american flag was hanging upside down in his son 's bedroom as the younger mcnamara told him that he was ashamed of america because of him . mcnaughton told mcnamara that after having talked to some of the young people that `` a feeling is widely and strongly held ... that 'the establishment ' is out of its mind '' and the dominant opinion was `` that we are trying to impose some u.s. image on distant peoples we can not understand and that we carrying the thing to absurd lengths . `` in a memo of <integer> may <year> to the president , mcnamara stated the military side of the war was going well with the americans killing thousands of the enemy every month , but the political side was not as south vietnam remained as dysfunctional as ever as he wrote : `` corruption is widespread . real government control is confined to enclaves . there is rot in the fabric '' . mcnamara wrote that the idea that the american forces would temporarily stabilize the situation so the south vietnamese could take over the war themselves was flawed as the dysfunctional south vietnamese state would never be able to win the war , thus meaning the americans would have to stay in vietnam for decades to come . he advised johnson not to accept westmoreland 's call for an additional 200,000 soldiers as that would mean calling up the reserves , which in turn would require a wartime economy . the economic sacrifices that ending the peacetime economy would entail would make it almost politically impossible to negotiate peace , and in effect would mean placing the hawks in charge , which was why those of a hawkish inclination kept pressing for the reserves to be called up . the economic sacrifices could only be justified to the american people by saying the war would be brought to a victorious conclusion . mcnamara rejected the advice of the hawks , warning that steps such as bombing north vietnam 's dikes and locks to flood the farmland with the aim of causing a famine ; mining the coast of north vietnam to sink soviet ships bringing in arms ; invading laos and cambodia ; and finally in the last resort using nuclear weapons if the other measures failed were likely to alienate world opinion and increase domestic opposition . mcnamara wrote : `` the picture of the world 's greatest superpower killing or seriously injuring 1,000 noncombatants a week , while trying to pound a tiny backward nation into submission on an issue whose merits are hotly disputed , is not a pretty one '' . finally , mcnamara dismissed the domino theory as irrelevant since general suharto had seized power in indonesia in <year> and proceeded to wipe out the indonesian communist party , the third-largest in the world , killing hundreds of thousands of indonesian communists . he argued that with suharto in power in indonesia that `` the trend in asia was now running in america 's favor , which reduced the importance of south vietnam '' . to the americans , indonesia was the most important of all the `` dominoes '' in southeast asia , and mcnamara argued that even if the south vietnamese `` domino '' were to fall , the indonesian `` domino '' would still stand . mcnamara commissioned the vietnam study task force on june <days> , <year> . he was inspired by the confrontation at harvard the previous november <days> he had discovered that the students he had been debating knew more about vietnam 's history than he did . the task was assigned to gelb and six officials who were instructed by mcnamara to examine just how and why the united states became involved in vietnam , starting with american relations with the viet minh in world war two . through gelb was a hawk who had written pro-war speeches for the republican senator jacob javits , he and his team became disillusioned as they wrote the history ; at one point when discussing what were the lessons of vietnam , paul gorman , one of the historians went up to the blackboard to write simply , `` do n't . '' <days> april <year> , the report of the office of the secretary of defense vietnam task force , as the pentagon papers were officially titled , was finished , but widely ignored within the government . intended as the official record of us military involvement in indochina , the final report ran to 3,000 pages and was classified as `` top secret – sensitive . '' the report was ultimately leaked in <year> to the new york times by daniel ellsberg , a former aide to mcnamara 's assistant secretary of defense , john mcnaughton . the leak became known as the pentagon papers , revealing that mcnamara and others had been aware that the vietnam offensive was futile . subsequent efforts by the nixon administration to prevent such leaks led indirectly to the watergate scandal . mcnamara said that the domino theory was the main reason for entering the vietnam war . in the same interview he stated , `` kennedy had n't said before he died whether , faced with the loss of vietnam , he would [ completely ] withdraw ; but i believe today that had he faced that choice , he would have withdrawn . '' === social equality === to commemorate president harry s truman 's signing an order to end segregation in the military , mcnamara issued directive 5120.36 on july <days> , <year> . this directive , equal opportunity in the armed forces , dealt directly with the issue of racial and gender discrimination in areas surrounding military communities . the directive declared , `` every military commander has the responsibility to oppose discriminatory practices affecting his men and their dependents and to foster equal opportunity for them , not only in areas under his immediate control , but also in nearby communities where they may live or gather in off-duty hours . '' ( para . ii.c . ) under the directive , commanding officers were obligated to use the economic power of the military to influence local businesses in their treatment of minorities and women . with the approval of the secretary of defense , the commanding officer could declare areas off-limits to military personnel for discriminatory practices . === expulsion of the chagos islanders === <days> july <year> , mcnamara was informed by the british defense minister , peter thorneycroft , that the financial burden of trying to maintain british forces around the world was too much , and that the british prime minister harold macmillan was considering a withdrawal of all british forces `` east of suez '' to end the british military presence in asia . mcnamara was opposed to the contemplated `` east of suez '' withdrawal , but the possibility of such a withdrawal led the u.s. navy to lobby for britain to allow an american naval base to be set up some british island in the indian ocean , a viewpoint that was formally endorsed by the joint chiefs of staff <days> january <year> . the memo by the joint chiefs mentioned that a major problem with british colonies was the rise of nationalist movements demanding independence , and expressed concern that if the united kingdom were to grant the united states a base in the indian ocean , an independence movement might demand the withdrawal of the americans . in <year> , britain granted air and naval bases in the colony of trinidad and tobago to the united states , but when trinidad and tobago became independent , the new government asked for the americans to leave . in addition , the chagossians were black , and the u.s. navy were convinced that having the chagossians living aside an american naval base would result in prostitution , which in turn would lead to american sailors being infected with venereal diseases , thus leading the navy to demand that the chagossians being evicted.in september <year> , thorneycroft visited washington to meet mcnamara and to begin talks about which british island in the indian ocean was to have the american base . by <year> , the americans had selected the island of diego garcia in the british colony of the chagos archipelago as the ideal place for maintaining air and naval bases that would allow the united states to control the indian ocean . mcnamara offered to have the united states pay $ <integer> million u.s. dollars annually in rent to the british government , a request that the british accepted . to prevent an independence movement in the chagos islands from emerging , the americans informed the british that they wanted all of the chagos islands expelled from their homes and never to be allowed to returned , a request that the british agreed . the british government expelled all of the chagossians from their homes starting in <year> . === abm === toward the end of his term mcnamara also opposed an anti-ballistic missile ( abm ) system proposed for installation in the u.s. in defense against soviet missiles , arguing the $ <integer> billion `` in itself is not the problem ; the penetrability of the proposed shield is the problem . '' under pressure to proceed with the abm program after it became clear that the soviets had begun a similar project , mcnamara finally agreed to a `` light '' system which he believed could protect against the far smaller number of chinese missiles . however , he never believed it was wise for the united states to move in that direction because of psychological risks of relying too much on nuclear weaponry and that there would be pressure from many directions to build a larger system than would be militarily effective . he always believed that the best defense strategy for the u.s. was a parity of mutually assured destruction with the soviet union . an abm system would be an ineffective weapon as compared to an increase in deployed nuclear missile capacity . === departure === mcnamara wrote of his close personal friendship with jackie kennedy and how she demanded that he stop the killing in vietnam . as mcnamara grew more and more controversial after <year> and his differences with the president and the joint chiefs of staff over vietnam strategy became the subject of public speculation , frequent rumors surfaced that he would leave office . by <year> , mcnamara was suffering visibly from the nervous strain as he went days without shaving and he suffered spasms where his jaw would quiver uncontrollably for hours . johnson said about him : `` you know , he 's a fine man , a wonderful man , bob mcnamara . he has given everything , just about everything , and , you know , we just ca n't afford another forrestal '' ( a reference to the first defense secretary , james forrestal , who committed suicide due to work-related stress and depression ) . senator john c. stennis was a conservative southern democrat who enjoyed much influence as a senior member of the senate armed forces committee . stennis saw himself more as a champion of the military rather than its overseer , and as such the military often leaked information to him , in the full knowledge that he would take up their cause on capitol hill . reflecting their unhappiness with mcnamara 's leadership , in the spring of <year> senior generals and admirals let stennis know of their belief that the defense secretary was mismanaging the war , which led him to schedule hearings for the senate armed forces committee <days> august <year> to examine the charge that `` unskilled civilian amateurs '' ( i.e . mcnamara ) were not letting `` professional military experts '' win the war as he charged that mcnamara had placed too many restrictions on bombing north vietnam to protect innocent north vietnamese civilians . the chairman of the senate armed forces committee , senator richard russell jr. , was opposed to the war , but he expressed his opposition in the most cautious and lukewarm terms as he did not wish to appear unpatriotic , and so the hawkish stennis enjoyed more power than his title of deputy chairman of the committee would suggest.the hearings opened on <integer> august <year> , and stennis called as his witnesses numerous admirals and air force generals who all testified to their belief that the united states was fighting with `` one arm tied behind its back '' , implicitly criticizing mcnamara 's leadership as they complained of `` overtly restrictive controls '' in bombing north vietnam that they claimed were preventing them from winning the war . when mcnamara himself appeared as a witness before the senate armed forces committee on <integer> august <year> , he defended the war in very lukewarm terms that strongly suggested he had lost faith in the war , testifying that the bombing campaign against north vietnam was ineffective , making the question of the bombing restrictions meaningless . mcnamara described all of the <integer> restricted targets as either of no importance such as a tire factory in hanoi that produced only <integer> tires per day or carried too much risk of hitting soviet ships bringing supplies to north vietnam . he warned that the prospect of american bombers damaging or sinking soviet merchantmen while wounding or killing soviet sailors carried too much risk of causing world war three . mcnamara testified that the bombing campaign had failed to reduce the supplies coming down the ho chi minh trail as the viet cong needed only <integer> tons of supplies per day to continue to fight and `` even if the quantity were five times that amount , it could be transported by only a few trucks '' . mcnamara went on to say that the bombing raids had not damaged the north vietnamese economy which was `` agrarian and simple '' and the north vietnamese people were unfamiliar with `` the modern comforts and conveniences that most of us in the western world take for granted '' . mcnamara also stated that north vietnamese morale was not broken by the bombing offensive as the north vietnamese people were `` accustomed to discipline and are no strangers to deprivation and death '' while everything indicated the leadership in hanoi were not affected by the bombing raids . thus , he lacked `` any confidence that they can be bombed to the negotiating table '' . mcnamara concluded that only some sort of genocide could actually win the war , stating : `` enemy operations in the south can not , on the basis of any reports i have seen be stopped by air bombardment-short , that is , of the virtual annihilation of north vietnam and its people '' .besides stennis , the other members of the senate armed forces committee were senators henry m. jackson , strom thurmond and stuart symington , all of whom were very hostile to mcnamara in their questioning of him . senator thurmond reproached mcnamara : `` i think it is a statement of placating the communists . it is a statement of appeasing the communists . it is a statement of no-win '' . privately , mcnamara felt that thurmond was an `` ass '' , saying he was a bigoted , ignorant southern politician whose only values were a mindless militarism , a fervent belief in white supremacy and a fondness for marrying women far younger than himself . mcnamara felt that it was beneath him to be questioned by thurmond , which explained why he was notably truculent in his answers to thurmond . stennis wrote the committee 's report which accused mcnamara of having `` consistently overruled the unanimous recommendations of military commanders and the joint chiefs of staff '' , whom stennis wrote had proposed `` systematic , timely and hard-hitting actions '' . stennis damned mcnamara for putting in bombing restrictions to protect north vietnamese civilians and claimed that the war could be easily won if only mcnamara would just obey all of the advice he received from the military . stennis was not influenced by the hearings as he had written the committee 's report before the hearings had even began . johnson saw the hearings as proof that it was time to dismiss mcnamara , whom he believed was `` cracking up '' under the strain of the war , as reflected in the defense secretary 's criticism of the rolling thunder bombings . stennis , an ardent white supremacist who had fiercely opposed johnson 's civil rights legislation , was an old enemy of johnson 's , which led the president to decide not to sack mcnamara <days> august <year> as that would be seen as a victory by stennis , and instead to wait a few months to fire mcnamara . in an interview with his biographer , doris kearns goodwin , johnson stated that mcnamara was `` cracking up '' as the pressures of the war were too much for him , and so he decided to fire him as it would have been `` a damn unfair thing to force him to stay '' . johnson had long resented and hated the kennedy brothers , whom he charged looked down upon him as `` white trash '' from texas . senator robert f. kennedy had emerged as a leading critic of the war by <year> , and johnson stated to kearns his belief that mcnamara had suffered a nervous breakdown , of which kennedy , a close friend of mcnamara , had taken advantage of . johnson told kearns : `` every day , bobby [ kennedy ] would call up mcnamara telling him that the war was terrible and immoral , and that he had to leave '' . to soften the blow , johnson claimed to kearns that he had talked it over with mcnamara and had decided to offer him the presidency of the world bank , `` the only job he really wanted then '' . johnson had chosen the job of world bank president for mcnamara because its rules prohibited the president from involving himself in the domestic affairs of member nations , which would prevent mcnamara from criticizing the war after he left office . johnson 's biggest fear was that if he fired mcnamara , then he might join with kennedy in criticizing him and the war ; given his status as the longest-serving defense secretary , such criticism would be especially damaging . when a reporter asked mcnamara if the stennis hearings indicated a rift between him and the joint chiefs of staff , mcnamara replied : `` my polices do n't differ with those of the joint chiefs and i think they would be the first to say it '' . general earle `` bus '' wheeler , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff had become dissatisfied with mcnamara 's leadership and was outraged by that remark . in response to mcnamara 's claim that the joint chiefs supported him , he proposed that the joint chiefs all resign in protest at mcnamara 's leadership . general harold k. johnson of the army , who erroneously blamed mcnamara for johnson 's decision not to call up the reserves in <year> , agreed to wheeler 's plan with his only regret being that he did not resign in <year> . the plan collapsed when general wallace m. greene of the marine corps refused to go along with it.on <integer> october <year> , mcnamara saw the march <days> the pentagon anti-war protest from his office in the pentagon as he witnessed hippie girls placed flowers in the guns of the d.c national guardsman standing in front of the pentagon . mcnamara described the scenes he witnessed as `` hellish '' as the hippie girls bared their breasts to tempt the guardsman to `` make love , not war '' while other hippies spitted in the faces of the guardsman . however , despite seeing the march <days> the pentagon demonstrators as a sign of social decay , his characteristic competitive spirit came to the fore as he argued that if he had been leading the march <days> the pentagon , he would had taken over the pentagon and shut it down , saying hippies lacked the necessary discipline and intelligence . on <integer> october <year> , mcnamara wrote johnson a memo which he sent the next day saying that the war could not be continued as it `` would be dangerous , costly in lives and unsatisfactory to the american people '' . johnson wrote on the margins on the memo remarks such as `` how do we get this conclusion ? '' and `` why believe this ? `` in an early november <year> memorandum to johnson , mcnamara 's recommendation to freeze troop levels , stop bombing north vietnam and for the u.s. to hand over ground fighting to south vietnam was rejected outright by the president . mcnamara 's recommendations amounted to his saying that the strategy of the united states in vietnam which had been pursued to date had failed . mcnamara later stated he `` never heard back '' from johnson regarding the memo . largely as a result , on november <days> of that year , mcnamara announced his pending resignation and that he would become president of the world bank . other factors were the increasing intensity of the anti-war movement in the u.s. , the approaching presidential campaign in which johnson was expected to seek re-election , and mcnamara 's support—over the objections of the joint chiefs of staff , of construction along the 17th parallel separating south and north vietnam of a line of fortifications running from the coast of vietnam into laos . the president 's announcement of mcnamara 's move to the world bank stressed his stated interest in the job and that he deserved a change after seven years as secretary of defense ( longer than any of his predecessors or successors ) . others give a different view of mcnamara 's departure from office . for example , stanley karnow in his book vietnam : a history strongly suggests that mcnamara was asked to leave by the president . the historian arthur schlesinger , jr stated that he was present during a conversation between mcnamara and senator kennedy during which the former told the latter that he only learned from reading the newspapers of johnson 's announcement that he had just `` resigned '' as defense secretary and had been appointed president of the world bank . mcnamara himself expressed uncertainty about the question . on <integer> november <year> , a story in the financial times of london based on leaked sources in washington stated mcnamara was going to be the next world bank president , which came as a considerable surprise to mcnamara . afterwards , mcnamara met with kennedy who told him to resign in protest and denounce the war as unwinnable , counsel that mcnamara rejected , saying that johnson had been a friend and that he was still loyal to him . when mcnamara refused to resign , kennedy told him that he should turn down the world bank presidency and join him in criticizing the war , which mcnamara refused to do . johnson knew that mcnamara was concerned about poverty in the third world , and that the possibility of serving as world bank president would be too tempting for mcnamara to resist.mcnamara left office on february <days> , <year> ; for his efforts , the president awarded him both the medal of freedom and the distinguished service medal . mcnamara 's last day as defense secretary was a memorable one . the hawkish national security adviser , walt whitman rostow , argued at a cabinet meeting that day that the united states was on the verge of winning the war . rostow urged johnson to send 206,000 more american troops to south vietnam to join the half-million already there and to drastically increase the number of bombing raids on north vietnam . at that point , mcnamara snapped in fury at rostow , saying : `` what then ? this goddamned bombing campaign , it 's worth nothing , it 's done nothing , they dropped more bombs than on all of europe in all of world war ii and it has n't done a fucking thing ! '' mcnamara then broke down in tears , saying to johnson to just accept that the war could not be won and stop listening to rostow . henry mcpherson , an aide to the president , recalled the scene : `` he reeled off the familiar statistics-how we had dropped more bombs on vietnam than on all of europe during world war ii . then his voice broke , and there were tears on his eyes as he spoke of the futility , the crushing futility of the air war . the rest of us sat silently-i for one with my mouth open , listening to the secretary of defense talk that way about a campaign for which he had , ultimately , been responsible . i was pretty shocked '' . shortly after mcnamara departed the pentagon , he published the essence of security , discussing various aspects of his tenure and position on basic national security issues . he did not speak out again on defense issues or vietnam until after he left the world bank . == world bank president == robert mcnamara served as head of the world bank from april <year> <days> june <year> , when he turned <integer> . <days> march <year> , mcnamara 's friend senator robert kennedy entered the democratic primaries with aim of challenging johnson . kennedy asked mcnamara to tape a statement praising his leadership during the cuban missile crisis with the understanding that the statement was meant for a tv ad . mcnamara praised kennedy 's `` shrewd diplomacy '' , saying he had `` remained calm and cool , firm , but restrained , never nettled and never rattled '' . though this was a violation of world bank rules , mcnamara felt guilty over refusing kennedy 's requests to resign and decline the world bank presidency . he was attacked for the tape with the new york times in an editorial lambasting him for his `` poor judgement and poorer taste '' . for a moment , mcnamara feared he would be fired from the world bank.a safe was installed in mcnamara 's office at the world bank to house his papers relating to his time as defense secretary , which was a normal courtesy extended to former defense secretaries who might face controversy over their actions and wish to defend themselves by quoting from the documentary record . when the pentagon papers were finished <days> april <year> , and a copy of the papers were brought into mcnamara 's office , he became angry and said : `` i do n't want to see it ! take it back ! '' by <year> , mcnamara wanted to forget the vietnam war and did not want any reminders of his former job . === tenure === in his <integer> years at the bank , he introduced key changes , most notably , shifting the bank 's economic development policies toward targeted poverty reduction . prior to his tenure at the world bank , poverty did not receive substantial attention as part of international and national economic development ; the focus of development had been on industrialization and infrastructure . poverty also came to be redefined as a condition faced by people rather than countries . according to martha finnemore , the world bank under mcnamara 's tenure `` sold '' states poverty reduction `` through a mixture of persuasion and coercion . '' mcnamara negotiated , with the conflicting countries represented on the board , a growth in funds to channel credits for development , in the form of health , food , and education projects . he also instituted new methods of evaluating the effectiveness of funded projects . one notable project started during mcnamara 's tenure was the effort to prevent river blindness.in <year> , mcnamara visited santiago to meet president salvador allende to discuss the latter 's policy of nationalization , especially of the copper mining companies . mcnamara 's son , craig mcnamara was living in chile at the time , but the two did not meet owning to the rift over the vietnam war . mcnamara files stated in <year> : `` i think my father truly respected allende-his compassion , his humility . but he disapproved of the nationalizations '' . the meeting with allende concluded with mcnamara ending all world bank loans to chile . on <integer> september <year> , allende was overthrown in a coup d'etat led by general augusto pinochet . in <year> , mcnamara visited santiago to meet pinochet and agreed to the world bank resuming loans to chile . craig mcnamara , who was visiting the united states at the time of the coup and chose not to return to chile was outraged by the decision to resume the loans , telling his father in a phone call : `` you ca n't do this-you always say the world bank is not a political institution , but financing pinochet clearly would be '' . mcnamara pere flatly stated in reply : `` it 's too late . i 've already made my decision '' . mcnamara fils feels that his father 's claim that he had to cease loans to chile because the allende government 's nationalization policy was an `` economic '' matter that fell within the purview of the world bank , but human rights abuses under pinochet were a `` political '' matter that was outside of the world bank 's purview was disingenuous and dishonest . craig mcnamara stated : `` i was really upset by that . that was hard to mend '' .the world bank currently has a scholarship program under his name.as world bank president , he declared at the <year> annual meeting of the international monetary fund and the world bank group that countries permitting birth control practices would get preferential access to resources . during the emergency in india , mcnamara remarked `` at long last , india is moving to effectively address its population problem , '' regarding the forced sterilization . == post–world bank activities and assessments == from <year> to <year> , mcnamara served on the board of trustees at american university in washington , d.c.in <year> , mcnamara joined several other former national security officials in urging that the united states pledge to not use nuclear weapons first in europe in the event of hostilities ; subsequently he proposed the elimination of nuclear weapons as an element of nato 's defense posture . in <year> , washington journalist deborah shapley published a <other> biography of robert mcnamara titled promise and power : the life and times of robert mcnamara . shapley concluded her book with these words : `` for better and worse mcnamara shaped much in today 's world – and imprisoned himself . a little-known nineteenth century writer , f.w . boreham , offers a summation : 'we make our decisions . and then our decisions turn around and make us . ' '' mcnamara 's memoir , in retrospect : the tragedy and lessons of vietnam , published in <year> , presented an account and analysis of the vietnam war from his point of view . according to his lengthy new york times obituary , `` [ h ] e concluded well before leaving the pentagon that the war was futile , but he did not share that insight with the public until late in life . in <year> , he took a stand against his own conduct of the war , confessing in a memoir that it was 'wrong , terribly wrong ' . '' in return , he faced a `` firestorm of scorn '' at that time . <days> november <year> , mcnamara returned to vietnam , this time visiting hanoi . despite his role as one of the architects of operation rolling thunder , mcnamara met with a surprisingly warm reception , even from those who survived the bombing raids , and was often asked to autograph pirate editions of in retrospect which had been illegally translated and published in vietnam . during his visit , mcnamara met his opposite number during the war , general võ nguyên giáp who served as north vietnam 's defense minister . the american historian charles neu who was present at the mcnamara-giáp meeting observed the differences in the style of the two men with mcnamara repeatedly interrupting giáp to ask questions , usually related to something numerical , while giáp gave a long leisurely monologue , quoting various vietnamese cultural figures such as poets , that began with vietnamese revolts against china during the years <integer> <other> ad when vietnam was a chinese province . neu wrote his impression was that mcnamara was a figure who thought in the short term while giáp thought in the long term.the fog of war : eleven lessons from the life of robert s. mcnamara is a <year> errol morris documentary consisting mostly of interviews with robert mcnamara and archival footage . it went on to win the academy award for documentary feature . the particular structure of this personal account is accomplished with the characteristics of an intimate dialogue . as mcnamara explains , it is a process of examining the experiences of his long and controversial period as the united states secretary of defense , as well as other periods of his personal and public life.the american anthologist david vine became interested in the subject of expulsion of the chagossians and part of his research tried to contact various american officials . some such as henry kissinger refused to respond , but mcnamara finally left a voicemail message on vine 's phone , saying : `` professor vine , this is robert mcnamara . i do n't believe i can help you . at <integer> , my memory is very , very bad . and i can recall nothing about diego garcia . thank you . '' vine returned his call , only for mcnamara to claim that he could not remember discussing with the british the fate of the chagossians , saying `` at <integer> , my memory is bad '' .mcnamara maintained his involvement in politics in his later years , delivering statements critical of the bush administration 's <year> invasion of iraq . on january <days> , <year> , mcnamara and most living former secretaries of defense and secretaries of state met briefly at the white house with president bush to discuss the war . == personal life == mcnamara married margaret craig , his teenage sweetheart , on august <days> , <year> . she was an accomplished cook , and robert 's favorite dish was reputed to be her beef bourguignon . margaret mcnamara , a former teacher , used her position as a cabinet spouse to launch a reading program for young children , reading is fundamental , which became the largest literacy program in the country . she died of cancer in <year> . later that summer , her ashes were scattered by her family on a mountainside meadow at buckskin pass , near snowmass village , colorado . the couple had two daughters and a son . the son robert craig mcnamara , who as a student objected to the vietnam war , is now a walnut and grape farmer in california . he is the owner of sierra orchards in winters , california . daughter kathleen mcnamara spears is a forester with the world bank . the second daughter is margaret elizabeth pastor.in the errol morris documentary , mcnamara reports that both he and his wife were stricken with polio shortly after the end of world war ii . although mcnamara had a relatively short stay in the hospital , his wife 's case was more serious and it was concern over meeting her medical bills that led to his decision to not return to harvard but to enter private industry as a consultant at ford motor company . === at ford === when working at ford motor company , mcnamara resided in ann arbor , michigan , rather than the usual auto executive domains of grosse pointe , birmingham , and bloomfield hills . he and his wife sought to remain connected with a university town ( the university of michigan ) after their hopes of returning to harvard after the war were put on hold . === alumnus of the year === in <year> , he was named alumnus of the year by the university of california , berkeley . === attempted assault === on september <days> , <year> , a passenger on the ferry to martha 's vineyard recognized mcnamara on board and attempted to throw him into the ocean . mcnamara declined to press charges . the man remained anonymous but was interviewed years later by author paul hendrickson , who quoted the attacker as saying , `` i just wanted to confront ( mcnamara ) on vietnam . '' === final years === after his wife 's death , mcnamara dated katharine graham , with whom he had been friends since the early 1960s . graham died in <year> . <days> september <year> , mcnamara wed diana masieri byfield , an italian-born widow who had lived in the united states for more than <integer> years . it was her second marriage . she was married for more than three decades to ernest byfield , a former oss officer and chicago hotel heir whose mother , gladys tartiere , leased her <other> ( 1.6 km² ) glen ora estate in middleburg , virginia , to john f. kennedy during his presidency.at the end of his life mcnamara was a life trustee on the board of trustees of the california institute of technology ( caltech ) , a trustee of the economists for peace and security , a trustee of the american university of nigeria , and an honorary trustee for the brookings institution . mcnamara died at his home in washington , d.c. , at <other> a.m. on july <days> , <year> , at the age of <integer> . he is buried at the arlington national cemetery in arlington , virginia , with the grave marker also commemorating his wives.mcnamara 's papers from his years as secretary of defense are housed in the john f. kennedy presidential library and museum in boston , massachusetts . == see also == list of california institute of technology trustees list of eagle scouts list of presidential medal of freedom recipients list of united states political appointments that crossed party lines mcnamara fallacy path to war project 100,000 project dye marker the fog of war == works == articles `` world population growth .

april <days> , <year> – april <days> , <year> ) was a russian american economist , famous as developer of the harrod–domar model . == life == evsey domar was born on april <days> , <year> in the polish city of łódź , which was part of russia at that time . he was raised and educated in russian outer manchuria , then emigrated to the united states in <year> . he received a bachelor of arts from ucla in <year> , a master of science from the university of michigan in <year> , a master of science from harvard university in <year> , and a doctorate from harvard in <year> . in <year> evsey domar married carola rosenthal . the couple had two daughters . he was a professor at the carnegie institute of technology , the university of chicago , the johns hopkins university and then at the massachusetts institute of technology from <year> until the end of his career . evsey domar was president of the association for comparative economics and a member of several other academic organizations including the american academy of arts and sciences , the econometric society , and the center for advanced study in the behavioral sciences . he was on the executive committee of the american economic association from <year> until <year> , and became the organization 's vice president in <year> . in <year> , he was the first recipient of the john r. commons award , given by the economics honor society omicron delta epsilon.he worked for the rand corporation , the ford foundation , the brookings institution , the national science foundation , the battelle memorial institute , and the institute for defense analysis . evsey domar died on april <days> , <year> in the emerson hospital in concord , massachusetts . == work == evsey domar was a keynesian economist . he made contributions to three main areas of economics : economic history , comparative economics and economic growth . in <year> he advanced the idea that economic growth served to lighten the deficit and the national debt . during the cold war he was also an expert on soviet economics . he is most known for developing , independently of british economist roy forbes harrod , what has become to be known as the harrod–domar model of economic growth . this model was the precursor to the neoclassical model of economic growth , differing mainly in its restrictive assumption that the leontief production function applied , which meant there would be fixed proportions of capital and labor in production , not substitution between them . in the model , economic growth was unstable . the solow–swan model that followed several years later borrowed heavily from the harrod-domar model and used a variable proportions cobb–douglas production function.domar 's <year> paper is cited as the source of domar aggregation , a set of rules and processes for combining industry growth data together to get aggregate industry sector or national growth . among his students was the economic historian robert fogel , who was awarded the nobel memorial prize in economics in <year> . == papers == the burden of the debt and the national income , <year> , aer . proportional income taxation and risk-taking , with richard musgrave , <year> . capital expansion , rate of growth and employment , <year> , econometrica . expansion and employment , <year> , aer . the problem of capital accumulation , <year> , aer . capital accumulation and the end of prosperity , <year> , proceedings of internat . statistical conference the effect of foreign investment on the balance of payments , <year> , aer . a theoretical analysis of economic growth , <year> , aer . depreciation , replacement and growth , <year> , ej . the case for accelerated depreciation , <year> , qje . essays in the theory of economic growth , <year> . on the measurement of technological change , <year> , the economic journal <other> ( dec. , <year> ) , 709–729 .

margarete `` grete '' wittkowski ( <integer> august <year> - <integer> october <year> ) was a german economist and politician ( kpd / sed ) . between <year> and <year> she served as deputy chair of the east german council of ministers , the only woman ever to hold this post . between <year> and <year> , she served as president of the east german national bank . == life == === provenance and early years === margarete wittkowski was born in posen . her father was a businessman : her mother was a pianist . she attended school in posen till <year> , when the family moved to berlin . here , between <year> and <year> , she studied social economics ( `` volkswirtschaftslehre '' ) . till <year> she was active in the zionist movement , after which , following `` discussions with leftist friends '' her political energies were increasingly focused on the communist party , which she joined <days> september <year> . === nazi germany , swiss exile ( <other> ) === <days> january <year> the political backdrop was transformed when the nazi party took power and converted germany into a one-party dictatorship . political activity - except in support of the nazi party - became illegal . at the end <days> february the reichstag fire was instantly blamed on the communists , and <days> march <year> those identified as communists began to be arrested . during <year> margarete wittkowski emigrated to switzerland , where she enrolled at basel university and worked on her doctorate dissertation . she passed the oral element of her doctoral exam , for which she was supervised by edgar salin and herman schmalenbach , <days> february <year> , for work concerning the relationships between the big banks in berlin and german industry . some sources indicate that she received her doctorate in 1934.she applied to the budge foundation for a research stipendium , but was unable to provide the necessary backup information to support a successful application . she was nevertheless able to pursue an academic career , working with jürgen kuczynski , a distinguished economist and , like her , a refugee from nazi germany . the focus of their work was a study entitled `` die wirtschaftspolitik der barbarei , hitlers neue europäische wirtschaftsordnung '' ( `` the economics of barbarism : hitler 's new economic order in europe '' ) , which in the end was published in <year> , and concerned the economic policy of the fascist states . the authors attacked the widespread contention that the economy in nazi germany was unusually efficient . it was their view that labour output was lower and the accident rate was higher than before <year> , and that earnings growth since then was attributable to monopoly practices , reduced raw material costs , a reduction in emphasis on consumer goods and an extension of working hours . there was also a warning directed at the united states ( at this stage still not militarily involved against germany ) that successful conquest by nazi germany of europe and the soviet union would give rise to a fascist european bloc capable of flooding the world with cheap manufactured goods.remarkably , between <year> and <year> , wittkowski continued to travel to germany , while taking care to hasten back to switzerland when the situation appeared to be becoming too dangerous . in the spring of <year> she moved to berlin where she co-produced a communist trades union newspaper with a like minded comrade called ullrich fuchs . early the next year she narrowly escaped arrest , emigrating again to switzerland <days> february <year> . she worked on several newspapers for distribution to southern germany , including an illegal newspaper aimed at farming communities . other newspapers for which she wrote include the `` süddeutsche volksstimme '' and `` süddeutsche informationen '' . she was also involved in distribution , according to one source making `` frequent trips to `` the southern baden border area where she handed over illegal publications and messages '' . there are references to her having at times undertaken her courier activities under the cover name `` hilde '' . there was also at least one visit to paris , <days> october <year> , which at this time had become the de facto headquarters of the germany communist party in exile . === british exile ( <other> ) === <days> november <year> , a few days after the `` kristallnacht '' pogroms across the border , wittkowski was arrested in zürich and expelled from the country for her `` illegal political activities '' . she lived - now illegally - in basel for another six months , after which , <days> april <year> , she succeeded in escaping to england , where her literary collaborator jürgen kuczynski had been based since <year> . sources are largely silent over her activities in england during the war years . unlike many political refugees from nazi germany , there is no record of her having been interned as an enemy alien by the english when war broke out , which may well reflect her work with kuczynski who had excellent connections with elements of the british establishment . it is on record that until <year> she worked for the comintern with harry pollitt , a leading member of the communist party . she appears to have been considered a leader among the exiled german communists in england . === soviet occupation zone ( <other> ) === margarete wittkowski returned to berlin <days> june <year> . the region surrounding the city was now administered as the soviet occupation zone , although the contentious creation of the socialist unity party ( `` sozialistische einheitspartei deutschlands '' / sed ) a couple of months earlier had already created a necessary precondition for its relaunch <days> october <year> as a new kind of one-party dictatorship , the german democratic republic ( east germany ) . wittkowski joined the sed in <year> . jürgen kuczynski was already back in town , and together they founded a weekly newspaper called `` die wirtschaft '' ( `` the economy '' ) . she also took charge of the economics section of neues deutschland , the newly established mass-circulation daily newspaper of the recently established socialist unity party . sources nevertheless indicate that wittkowski objected to being given work as a journalist because she wished to contribute more directly to rebuilding the country.in <year> or <year> she joined the german economic commission established by the occupation forces . working closely with bruno leuschner , this involved a central role in devising the planned economic model for the new socialist german state . in <other> she attended a course at the party academy . there was a study period in moscow . in <other> she served as vice president on the german economic commission for what had become , <days> october <year> , the german democratic republic ( east germany ) . === german democratic republic ( <other> ) === in <year> wittkowski was transferred to the consumer co-operatives association , an office she held till <year> . this was a demotion , attributed by one source to an emulation by walter ulbricht of stalin 's <year> purge of `` zionist conspirators '' . others , referring to her time in england , are content to point out that during this time `` those who had emigrated to the west were more likely to be considered as unreliable comrades '' . whatever the reason for her removal from the german economic commission , it does appear that wittkowski was respected for her formidable intellect , which unlike others she was sometimes willing to deploy in discussions involving walter ulbricht , the country 's leader.after stalin died , <days> march <year> , the east german party leadership became slightly less nervous , and in <year> she was reinstated as deputy president of what had now become the state planning commission , which gave her significant influence over national economic policy . <days> april <year> wittkowski was also elected a member of the powerful party central committee , which under the leninist power structure employed in east germany was the real focus of political power . she also sat as a member of the national parliament ( `` volkskammer '' ) between <year> and <year> , and again between <year> and 1967.between <year> and <year> , wittkowski found herself increasingly out of line with the leadership , both because of differences over aspects of economic policy and because she sought to open a spirit of wider debate . in a speech delivered on <integer> march <year> to the central committee plenum she criticised ulbricht over his failure to brief central committee members on the momentous events at the soviet 20th party congress in moscow the previous month : she urged a little more openness within the east german central committee . wittkowski advocated greater priority be given to profitability and the needs of the population . at the central committee plenum <days> november <year> she called for greater decentralisation of economic decision making . addressing the central committee plenum <days> november <year> , she criticised the `` bureaucratic '' actions of many functionaries , which she characterised as discrediting the `` party and the government '' . she also appealed for a less confrontational policy with socialists in the german federal republic , where a court imposed ban on the communist party <days> august <year> failed to trigger significant protests by west german workers . there were two german states but there was only one german working class . wittkowski might have taken a lead within the central committee in criticising aspects of economic policy , but she was not a lone voice . inside the central committee , karl schirdewan and ernst wollweber were voicing similar sentiments . other prominent critics of the party line were gerhart ziller , fred oelßner and fritz selbmann.however , whereas wittkowski saw in the social democratic party ( spd ) in west germany a potential ally in support of workers and in opposition to the adenauer régime , ulbricht saw the western spd , even before publication in <year> of the godesberg program , as irredeemably counter-revolutionary . the idea that one might `` do business '' with them was a repudiation of valued stalinist dogma . more generally , he was underwhelmed by her economic and other criticisms . her advocacy of `` socialist self-management '' led to a charge of `` managerism '' . <days> february <year> the central committee plenum endorsed the orthodox line advocated by general secretary ulbricht : wittkowski underwent a `` temporary demotion '' . ( for the other critics named in the previous paragraph demotion was permanent ) she was removed from her deputy presidency of the state planning commission and her name was no longer included on the party list for the volkskammer election that year . she was also resigned from the central committee , although her name now appeared on the list of candidates for central committee membership , an indulgence not afforded to comrades schirdewan and wollweber.she was quickly restored to the state planning commission vice-presidency , although now there was more than one vice-president so that her relative stature within the body was diminished . a few years later , after <year> , the economic reforms branded as the `` new economic system '' , reflecting a modest loosening of centralised control across the entire `` eastern bloc '' seemed to acknowledge concerns that had been expressed by wittkowski three years before . she herself remained at this point outside the party central committee politburo , but her principal interlocutor within it was werner jarowinsky who had been a pupil of her old friend and literary collaborator , jürgen kuczynski . <days> february <year> she resigned from the state planning commission for the last time and took up a post as a deputy chair of the council of ministers , where her departmental responsibilities covered trade , supply , and agriculture . over the years there were many deputy chairmen of the council of ministers , but wittkowski was the only woman ever to be numbered among them . she held this post till july <year> . meanwhile , in <year> she was readmitted to the party central committee.margarete wittkowski 's final big job , to which she was appointed in <year> , was the presidency of what was renamed , on <integer> january <year> , the east german central bank ( staatsbank ) . she held this position until her death , which took place while she was travelling , at singen on the southwestern edge of west germany . == references == david mervyn blow ( <integer> june <year> – <integer> june <year> ) was an influential british biophysicist . he was best known for the development of x-ray crystallography , a technique used to determine the molecular structures of tens of thousands of biological molecules . this has been extremely important to the pharmaceutical industry . == early life and education == blow was born in birmingham , england . he was educated at kingswood school in bath , somerset and the university of cambridge where he won a scholarship to corpus christi college , cambridge . his phd was awarded in <year> for x-ray analysis of haemoglobin supervised by max perutz . == career and research == following graduation from cambridge , blow spent two years at the massachusetts institute of technology ( mit ) and the national institutes of health ( nih ) funded by the fulbright foundationin <year> , he met max perutz ; they began to study a new technique wherein x-rays would be passed through a protein sample . this eventually led to the creation of a three-dimensional structure of haemoglobin . blow was appointed professor of biophysics at imperial college london in <year> . his doctoral students include richard henderson , paul sigler , and alice vrielink . === awards and honours === blow was elected a fellow of the royal society ( frs ) in <year> . he was awarded the wolf prize in chemistry in <year> . == personal life == blow married mavis sears in <year> , and they had two children , a son julian and a daughter elizabeth . he died of lung cancer at the age of <integer> , in appledore , torridge ( near bideford ) , devon . == references == oleg georgievich gazenko ( russian : олег георгиевич газенко ;

zoologist in the 1930s , specializing in ornithology . his zoological explorations in tibet served as a cover for his role in the german secret service . he was also a scientific member in the ahnenerbe and held the rank of an ss-sturmbannführer . == early life == schäfer was born in cologne , and even as a young boy , he spent time in the outdoors shooting with an air gun and rearing birds , insects and reptiles . after high school ( abitur <year> from mannheim ) , he worked at vogelwarten in denmark and heligoland . he then joined the university of göttingen and studied zoology , botany and geology . he was a fan of the swedish geographer sven hedin . he met hugo weigold on a study trip to helgoland , which led him to join weigold and american brooke dolan ii from the philadelphia academy of sciences to china in 1930–31 . he published berge , buddhas und bären ( mountains , buddhas and bears ) in <year> , based on the trip and gained wide recognition . in <year> , dolan invited schäfer for a second trip into tibet in <year> , which affected his studies in the university of göttingen under professor alfred kühn . he then transferred to the friedrich wilhelm

affected him for months . he completed his ph.d. in <year> , based on his studies of the birds of tibet . schäfer joined the schutzstaffel in <year> but , after world war ii , he claimed to have been an unwilling recruit who joined only to advance his scientific career . == expedition == in <year> , he was appointed untersturmführer in the personal staff , and in <year> he was promoted to sturmbannführer . he led the third expedition to tibet in 1938–39 under the patronage of heinrich himmler , the ss , and various sponsors . as many as 3,300 bird specimens were collected in these expeditions . a film was produced on the expedition titled geheimnis tibet ( secret tibet ) . himmler was personally interested in the project due to various pet pseudo-scientific theories that he subscribed to including ideas such as human origins , and hanns hörbiger 's welteislehre ( `` world ice theory '' ) .in july <year> , during his second expedition in asia , he met the then exiled panchen lama , thubten chökyi nyima , at a mountain temple near hangzhou , china . he describes the lama as a kindly , sympathetic man who enquired about how far germany was and whether he had been waylaid by any robbers on the way.the ss ahnenerbe expedition to tibet during the 1930s was also successful for the german naturalists `` meanwhile , ernst schäfer and bruno beger , edmund geer and krause carefully packed up the voluminous natural history collection- animal and bird skins ; butterflies , bees , ants , wasps and other insect specimens ; fragile dried plants for the herbarium ; packets of seeds containing one thousand , six hundred varieties of barley , seven hundred varieties of wheat , and seven hundred varieties of oats ; not to mention hundreds of seeds from other potentially useful plants . `` : <integer> these seeds collected during the tibetan expeditions were important , as heinrich himmler planned to develop hardy new varieties of crops in order to boost the agricultural yields of colonies across the eastern territories of the ukraine and crimea . himmler ordered the ahnenerbe to found a teaching and research institute in plant genetics , assigning the task to dr. ernst schäfer , who he found to be an ideal young german zoologist who could also lead the tibet expedition . schäfer set to work with characteristic vigor . he obtained a staff of seven research scientists , including a british prisoner of war , and set up an experimental research station in lannach , near the city of graz in austria . there the new institute went to work , experimenting with samples of grains that schäfer had acquired from the granaries of the tibetan nobility . : <integer> a statue in a german private collection which has come to be called the `` iron man '' is speculated to have been obtained by ernst schäfer during the tibet expedition in <year> as part of the tibet mission that was supported by himmler . there is no proof that this was indeed obtained during the expedition but it has been a subject of considerable speculation . analysis showed that it was made from iron of meteoric origin , specifically of an ataxite class , an extremely rare type , of meteorite and possibly carved from a piece of the chinga meteorite . the statue is believed to portray the god vaisravana . speculation that it belongs to the pre-buddhist bon culture that existed in asia about 1,000 years ago has been brought into question due to certain incoherent features of clothing and style.in <year> , schäfer was awarded the war merit cross , 2nd class with swords . he was made an honorary member of the german ornithologists federation ( do-g ) on <integer> december <year> , his wedding day , a gift from erwin stresemann . == postwar career == after the <year> expedition he returned to germany and he married ursula in december <days> in <year> schäfer was interned by the allied military government but was exonerated for war crimes <days> june <year> and released . in <year> he moved with his wife and daughter to venezuela and conducted studies there while also teaching in maracay and caracas . from <year> to <year> he was a professor in venezuela , when he returned to europe to become an adviser to the belgian king leopold iii . with film-maker heinz sielmann , he produced herrscher des urwalds ( rulers of the wild ) ( <year> ) in the congo

'' the economist called him `` one of the visionaries of international development . '' he was widely regarded as `` the most articulate and persuasive spokesman for the developing world '' . == early life and education == mahbub ul haq was born in gurdaspur in pre-independence punjab province , now in the republic of india , on <integer> february <year> . he belonged to an `` urdu-speaking family . '' his teenage years saw religious violence and forced migration associated with the independence of pakistan and india <days> august <year> . he and his family narrowly escaped from being killed in one of the refugee trains heading to pakistan . the nature of the religious violence left a lasting impression on mahbub ul haq . after reaching lahore , haq was given government-sponsored housing and decided to continue his education . in <year> haq graduated with a degree in economics from government college lahore . he earned a scholarship to attend cambridge university where he earned another ba in the same discipline . at cambridge , haq gained his ba alongside amartya sen , with whom he formed a close , lifelong friendship . after renewing his scholarship , haq went to united states for his doctoral studies at yale university and earned a phd in economics . later , haq carried out post-doctoral work at harvard university in 1960–61 . == career == an early proponent of economic liberalization who in later years argued that poor countries failed to prosper because they neglected the basic development of their people upon returning to pakistan in <year> at the age of <integer> , haq joined the planning commission as assistant chief while it prepared its first five-year plan . influenced by the dominant economic thought in american academia , haq advocated capitalism as the economic base of the national economy and helped guide the government to apply free-market principles to boost the economy . this approach was wholeheartedly embraced by the military government of general ayub khan after it came to power <days> october <year> . by the 1960s as chief economist of the planning commission haq was delivering speeches all over the country in support these economic policies . while the international community was applauding pakistan as a model of development , haq developed concerns that all was not well with the distribution of the benefits of growth . rapid economic development made haq 's team doubt the long-term viability of such a pattern of growth , and he increasingly supported heavier taxation of the asset owning classes . in a widely reported speech to the applied economics research centre at the university of karachi <days> april <year> , haq alleged that `` <integer> industrial family groups had come to dominate the economic and financial life-cycle of pakistan and that they controlled about two-thirds of industrial assets , <integer> % of banking and <integer> % of insurance assets in the industrial domain .

movement that led to field marshal ayub khan 's overthrow <days> march <year> . following ayub 's fall , haq accepted an invitation from robert mcnamara , president of the world bank to serve as his director of policy planning . during his tenure ( 1970–82 ) , haq influenced the bank 's development philosophy and lending policies , steering more attention towards poverty alleviation programmes and increased allocations for small farm production , nutrition , education , water supply and other social sectors . he wrote a study that served as a precursor to the basic needs and human development approaches of the 1980s . while working at the world bank , haq was invited by prime minister zulfiqar ali bhutto to join the ministry of finance , but ultimately refused as he had strong opposing views on bhutto 's program of nationalization . in <year> bhutto again asked mahbub to return to pakistan and join his administration in devising a strategy that would lift a large number of pakistanis out of poverty and stagflation , but their major differences persuaded haq not to return.in <year> haq returned at the request of general zia-ul-haq 's military government , where he assumed directorship of the planning commission . in <year> haq was appointed minister of planning and development . according to parvez hasan 'under mahbub 's direction , the planning commission became once again a lively place and began to exert powerful influence on social sector issues , including education and family planning , much neglected in earlier zia years . in <year> president zia oversaw a partial return to democracy with so-called 'non-party ' general elections , and haq was sworn in as minister finance , planning and economic affairs in the pml government of mohammed khan junejo . haq 's is credited with significant tax reforms , deregulation of the economy , increased emphasis on human development and several initiatives for poverty alleviation . despite this major acceleration in social spending haq was forced to resign <days> january <year> due to protests at his reforms . he was reappointed as finance minister in the caretaker administration established by gen. zia-ul-haq after he dismissed the junejo government <days> may <year> . haq 's term ended when the ppp government of benazir bhutto was sworn in following the general elections <days> november <year> . in <year> , he was appointed as special advisor to the undp administrator william draper in new york city to produce the first human development report . in this capacity , haq initiated the concept of human development and the human development report as its project director . he led a team of international scholars including amartya sen , paul streeten , inge kaul , frances stewart , and richard jolly to prepare annual human development reports . in <year> , haq founded the human development center in islamabad , pakistan — a policy research institute committed to organizing professional research , policy studies and seminars in the area of human development , with a special focus on south asia . in acknowledgement of his contributions , the human development centre ,

'' == biography == parker grew up in lancaster , pennsylvania and became interested in birdwatching at an early age . in <year> he broke the north american big year record ( seeing more species of birds in a year than anyone before ) . in that year he enrolled at the university of arizona and began to accompany ornithological expeditions to south america , particularly with louisiana state university . he moved to baton rouge and was associated with lsu for the rest of his life ( becoming a fanatical supporter of lsu basketball ) . he supported himself by leading birding tours , especially for victor emanuel nature tours , until the last few years of his life , when he went to work for conservation international . == identification skills == according to zimmer ( <year> ) , `` voice , microhabitat , and behavior are the keys [ to identification ] in neotropical forests , and ted was not only the first to recognize this ( his seminal paper on foliage-gleaner identification that appeared in the april <year> issue of continental birdlife should be required reading for all students of tropical birding ) , but also honed his discrimination of these essential cues to a finer degree than anyone else . '' zimmer adds that as knowledge of these matters was limited , `` [ m ] any field problems… took weeks of patient effort for ted to work out for himself . `` if another ornithologist played parker a tape of an unknown bird , he could usually recognize it and could often identify other species in the background noise . he might then , by his knowledge of bird ranges , state where the tape had been made—zimmer gives the example of `` south bank of the amazon between the rios madeira and tapajos '' .he could identify bird calls and songs even in the presence of many other birds , as when the bird was a member of a mixed-species flock . on more than one occasion , he identified a bird new to him by its call , since he recognized the genus and knew what species lived in the area . once , hearing a recording of a dawn chorus in bolivia , he realized that one of the sounds was an antwren of the genus herpsilochmus—but since he knew all the sounds of those birds , he knew he was hearing a previously unknown species . the following year , the new species was discovered . the scale of this knowledge is given by the presence of over two thousand bird species in the andes and amazon , where parker did most of his field work ; each species typically has at least three vocalizations . he kept them straight not only from each other but from the region 's monkeys , amphibians , and insects as well . == methods == don stap describes parker 's method : walking slowly down a trail , pausing after every step , and watching and listening . in this way he gained his knowledge of both detail and `` common patterns in behavior or vocalizations or community structure across the continent '' , which led jon fjeldså and niels krabbe to call him `` by far the greatest specialist on the life histories of neotropical birds there ever was '' . stap also notes that parker generally did not shoot birds for study , a normal method of field ornithology.when leading tours , parker would lure flocks in by recording their sounds as he heard them and then immediately playing the tape back ; he would predict where the flock would come into sight and arrange his clients to give each a good view . the flock would appear as predicted . == contributions == parker willingly shared his knowledge with others informally , published extensively , and contributed over 10,000 recordings to the macaulay library of natural sounds at the cornell laboratory of ornithology . when he went to work for conservation international , he conceived of an interdisciplinary program to provide scientific information in south america 's conservation crises . this rapid assessment program has led to the creation of many parks and reserves . parker was doing a survey for it in western ecuador when he was killed in a plane crash along with three others , including the botanist alwyn howard gentry . the theodore a. parker iii natural area in lancaster county , pennsylvania , and the parker/gentry award for conservation biology are named for him . == references == == further reading == bancroft , g. thomas and j. v. remsen ( eds . ) ( <year> ) . studies in neotropical ornithology

<integer> september <year> in munich , germany ) was a renowned czech medical doctor who specialized in the treatment of children with cerebral palsy and developmental disorders . he discovered the principle of reflex locomotion , which is used to treat various physical and neuromuscular disorders through the stimulation of the human sensomotoric system 's reflex points . originally used in the treatment of spastic children , the technique is now used on babies and adults . == biography == === early life and education === vojta began his studies in prague in <year> , but due to the nazi occupation , he was forced to postpone them , eventually earning his doctoral degree <integer> years later , in <year> . he pursued training in pediatric neurology , working in the clinic at charles university in prague , and in <year> , he became head of the department of pediatric neurology at the 4th neurological clinic of the medical faculty of charles university in prague . dr. vojta is most noted for his work in developmental kinesiology and his discovery of reflex locomotion therapy , which became broadly known as the vojta method . === exile in germany === in <year> , soviet troops invaded czechoslovakia , disrupting vojta ’ s work and posing a threat to his professional future . vojta , along with his wife and three small children , sought refuge in germany . there , vojta began work as a research fellow at the orthopedic clinic of the university of cologne , pursuing his work in developmental kinesiological studies , and organizing courses in diagnostics and physical therapy . in <year> , dr. vojta relocated to munich , taking a position at the munich children ’ s centre , where he became head of the rehabilitation department . in <year> , after the fall of the communist regime , vojta returned to his native czechoslovakia to receive tenure as professor of pediatric neurology and rehabilitation from charles university in prague , an honor denied him as a “ politically unreliable person ” under the soviet regime . he was able to teach there once again , and continued to do so until his retirement in <year> . after his retirement , vojta continued to lecture and teach around the world until his death in <year> . == career == === the vojta method === vojta ’ s research was focused on reflex locomotion therapy , particularly in the treatment of children exhibiting developmental delays . he discovered the basis of reflex locomotion while searching for treatment therapies for children with cerebral palsy and spastic paralysis . he discovered that muscle groups that the children could not activate themselves can be activated by applying pressure to specific zones on a patient ’ s body . repeated activation resulted in improved gait , better posture and improved speech in children with cerebral palsy . professor vojta recognized that many of the movement complexes he found could be traced to common subjective global patterns of movement that mark developmental milestones in healthy children . although the emphasis of vojta ’ s work was initially directed to pediatrics , he very soon recognized that the treatment could also be applied to neurological problems in adult patients . however , vojta therapy is most effective in patients under the age of six months , an age when early developmental changes are most profound . vojta therapists use a combination of <integer> different zones on a patient 's body , applying light pressure on a specific area and resistance to the current movement , causing the patient 's body to involuntarily perform certain reflexive movement patterns . repeated stimulation appears to make previously blocked neurological connections between the patient 's spinal cord and brain . the patient is eventually able to perform similar movements without any external stimulation . vojta therapy has been used to treat cerebral palsy , peripheral paralysis of the arms and legs , hip dysplasia , and problems in breathing , swallowing and chewing . in recent years , the principles underlying vojta 's method have been adapted to dynamic neuromuscular stimulation or dns , a modern iteration of vojta therapy . dns therapy has been successfully used to rehabilitate athletic injury and enhance performance , leading to a reduction in injury , decreased recovery time , and increased performance markers . when an adult athlete or patient is injured , they sometimes revert to an early pattern of locomotion similar to that of a young infant , before proper control was established . for example , a patient with a shoulder impingement may internally rotate and flex their arm in a way similar to a two-month-old child who has not yet developed external rotation and extension . in this case , dns places an adult patient in a developmental position to re-teach proper control of the shoulder joint . while vojta therapy has been recognized for decades as a viable treatment method throughout europe and asia , it has only recently made inroads in the united states , particularly among physical therapists . as research and practice of the vojta method grow , dr. vojta ’ s contributions to the fields of physical therapy and physical performance will undoubtedly gain universal recognition . == published works and training == vojta published over <integer> scientific works and two textbooks , cerebral movement disturbances in infancy and the vojta principle , written with anne peters . both have appeared in several editions and been translated into several languages . his works have inspired further research and additional scientific works worldwide . in <year> , vojta and his german colleagues formed the vojta society , dedicated to promoting and disseminating the principles of reflex locomotion in diagnostics and therapy , with the goal of training physiotherapists and physicians in the vojta method . in <year> , the organization was renamed the international vojta society , over which professor vojta presided until his death . the non-profit society , with its headquarters in munich , runs annual qualification seminars in germany for health care professionals . training around <integer> doctors and physiotherapists a year , the qualification seminars focus on treatment of new-born babies , children and adults . before his death , professor vojta traveled extensively , conducting seminars and training sessions worldwide . == awards and recognitions == vojta received recognition in the form of awards and honors for his work throughout his career . in <year> he was awarded the heinrich heine prize , the highest award of the german society for orthopedics . in <year> he received the `` growing with each other '' medal from the german association aktion sonnenschein for his work with disabled children . in <year> , he won the ernst von bergmann prize for training in medicine from the german medical association . in <year> , vojta was awarded the von pfaundler medal for training in pediatrics from the professional association of pediatricians . <days> october <year> , vojta was posthumously awarded the czech order of merit by vaclav havel , the president of the czech republic . == references == == external links == official website herbert alexander simon ( june <days> , <year> – february <days> , <year> ) was an american political scientist , with a ph.d. in political science , whose work also influenced the fields of computer science , economics , and cognitive psychology . his primary research interest was decision-making within organizations and he is best known for the theories of `` bounded rationality '' and `` satisficing '' . he received the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences in <year> and the turing award in computer science in <year> . his research was noted for its interdisciplinary nature and spanned across the fields of cognitive science , computer science , public administration , management , and political science . he was at carnegie mellon university for most of his career , from <year> to 2001.notably , simon was among the pioneers of several modern-day scientific domains such as artificial intelligence , information processing , decision-making , problem-solving , organization theory , and complex systems . he was among the earliest to analyze the architecture of complexity and to propose a preferential attachment mechanism to explain power law distributions . == early life and education == herbert alexander simon was born in milwaukee , wisconsin on june <days> , <year> . simon 's father , arthur simon ( 1881–1948 ) , was a jewish electrical engineer who came to the united states from germany in <year> after earning his engineering degree at technische hochschule darmstadt . an inventor , arthur also was an independent patent attorney . simon 's mother , edna marguerite merkel ( <other> ) , was an accomplished pianist whose ancestors came from prague and cologne . simon 's european ancestors were piano makers , goldsmiths , and vintners . like his father , simon 's mother also came from a family with jewish , lutheran , and catholic backgrounds.simon attended milwaukee public schools , where he developed an interest in science and established himself as an atheist . while attending middle school , simon wrote a letter to `` the editor of the milwaukee journal defending the civil liberties of atheists '' . unlike most children , simon 's family introduced him to the idea that human behavior could be studied scientifically ; his mother 's younger brother , harold merkel ( <other> ) , who studied economics at the university of wisconsin–madison under john r. commons , became one of his earliest influences . through harold 's books on economics and psychology , simon discovered social science . among his earliest influences , simon cited norman angell for his book the great illusion and henry george for his book progress and poverty . while attending high school , simon joined the debate team , where he argued `` from conviction , rather than cussedness '' in favor of george 's single tax.in <year> , simon entered the university of chicago , and , following his early influences , decided to study social science and mathematics . simon was interested in studying biology but chose not to pursue the field because of his `` color-blindness and awkwardness in the laboratory '' . at an early age , simon learned he was color blind and discovered the external world is not the same as the perceived world . while in college , simon focused on political science and economics . simon 's most important mentor was henry schultz , an econometrician and mathematical economist . simon received both his b.a . ( <year> ) and his ph.d. ( <year> ) in political science from the university of chicago , where he studied under harold lasswell , nicolas rashevsky , rudolf carnap , henry schultz , and charles edward merriam . after enrolling in a course on `` measuring municipal governments , '' simon became a research assistant for clarence ridley , and the two co-authored measuring municipal activities : a survey of suggested criteria for appraising administration in <year> . simon 's studies led him to the field of organizational decision-making , which became the subject of his doctoral dissertation . == career == after graduating with his undergraduate degree , simon obtained a research assistantship in municipal administration which turned into a directorship at the university of california , berkeley . from <year> to <year> , simon was a professor of political science and also served as department chairman at illinois institute of technology in chicago . there , he began participating in the seminars held by the staff of the cowles commission who at that time included trygve haavelmo , jacob marschak , and tjalling koopmans . he thus began an in-depth study of economics in the area of institutionalism . marschak brought simon in to assist in the study he was currently undertaking with sam schurr of the `` prospective economic effects of atomic energy '' .from <year> to <year> , simon was a faculty member at carnegie-mellon university , in pittsburgh , pennsylvania . in <year> , simon became a professor of administration and chairman of the department of industrial management at carnegie institute of technology ( `` carnegie tech '' ) , which , in <year> , became carnegie-mellon university . simon later also taught psychology and computer science in the same university , ( occasionally visiting other universities ) . == research == seeking to replace the highly simplified classical approach to economic modeling , simon became best known for his theory of corporate decision in his book administrative behavior . in this book he based his concepts with an approach that recognized multiple factors that contribute to decision making . his organization and administration interest allowed him to not only serve three times as a university department chairman , but he also played a big part in the creation of the economic cooperation administration in <year> ; administrative team that administered aid to the marshall plan for the u.s. government , serving on president lyndon johnson 's science advisory committee , and also the national academy of science . simon has made a great number of contributions to both economic analysis and applications . because of this , his work can be found in a number of economic literary works , making contributions to areas such as mathematical economics including theorem , human rationality , behavioral study of firms , theory of casual ordering , and the analysis of the parameter identification problem in econometrics . === decision-making === administrative behavior , first published in <year> and updated across the years , was based on simon 's doctoral dissertation . it served as the foundation for his life 's work . the centerpiece of this book is the behavioral and cognitive processes of humans making rational decisions . by his definition , an operational administrative decision should be correct , efficient , and practical to implement with a set of coordinated means.simon recognized that a theory of administration is largely a theory of human decision making , and as such must be based on both economics and on psychology . he states : [ if ] there were no limits to human rationality administrative theory would be barren . it would consist of the single precept : always select that alternative , among those available , which will lead to the most complete achievement of your goals . ( p xxviii ) contrary to the `` homo economicus '' stereotype , simon argued that alternatives and consequences may <days> partly known , and means and ends imperfectly differentiated , incompletely related , or poorly detailed.simon defined the task of rational decision making is to select the alternative that results in the more preferred set of all the possible consequences . correctness of administrative decisions was thus measured by : adequacy of achieving the desired objective efficiency with which the result was obtainedthe task of choice was divided into three required steps : identifying and listing all the alternatives determining all consequences resulting from each of the alternatives ; comparing the accuracy and efficiency of each of these sets of consequencesany given individual or organization attempting to implement this model in a real situation would be unable to comply with the three requirements . simon argued that knowledge of all alternatives , or all consequences that follow from each alternative is impossible in many realistic cases.simon attempted to determine the techniques and/or behavioral processes that a person or organization could bring to bear to achieve approximately the best result given limits on rational decision making . simon writes : the human being striving for rationality and restricted within the limits of his knowledge has developed some working procedures that partially overcome these difficulties . these procedures consist in assuming that he can isolate from the rest of the world a closed system containing a limited number of variables and a limited range of consequences . therefore , simon describes work in terms of an economic framework , conditioned on human cognitive limitations : economic man and administrative man . administrative behavior addresses a wide range of human behaviors , cognitive abilities , management techniques , personnel policies , training goals and procedures , specialized roles , criteria for evaluation of accuracy and efficiency , and all of the ramifications of communication processes . simon is particularly interested in how these factors influence the making of decisions , both directly and indirectly.simon argued that the two outcomes of a choice require monitoring and that many members of the organization would be expected to focus on adequacy , but that administrative management must pay particular attention to the efficiency with which the desired result was obtained.simon followed chester barnard , who stated `` the decisions that an individual makes as a member of an organization are quite distinct from his personal decisions '' . personal choices may <days> determined whether an individual joins a particular organization and continue to be made in his or her extra–organizational private life . as a member of an organization , however , that individual makes decisions not in relationship to personal needs and results , but in an impersonal sense as part of the organizational intent , purpose , and effect . organizational inducements , rewards , and sanctions are all designed to form , strengthen , and maintain this identification.simon saw two universal elements of human social behavior as key to creating the possibility of organizational behavior in human individuals : authority ( addressed in chapter vii—the role of authority ) and in loyalties and identification ( addressed in chapter x : loyalties , and organizational identification ) . authority is a well-studied , primary mark of organizational behavior , straightforwardly defined in the organizational context as the ability and right of an individual of higher rank to guide the decisions of an individual of lower rank . the actions , attitudes , and relationships of the dominant and subordinate individuals constitute components of role behavior that may vary widely in form , style , and content , but do not vary in the expectation of obedience by the one of superior status , and willingness to obey from the subordinate.loyalty was defined by simon as the `` process whereby the individual substitutes organizational objectives ( service objectives or conservation objectives ) for his own aims as the value-indices which determine his organizational decisions '' . this entailed evaluating alternative choices in terms of their consequences for the group rather than only for oneself or one 's family.decisions can be complex admixtures of facts and values . information about facts , especially empirically-proven facts or facts derived from specialized experience , are more easily transmitted in the exercise of authority than are the expressions of values . simon is primarily interested in seeking identification of the individual employee with the organizational goals and values . following lasswell , he states that `` a person identifies himself with a group when , in making a decision , he evaluates the several alternatives of choice in terms of their consequences for the specified group '' . a person may identify himself with any number of social , geographic , economic , racial , religious , familial , educational , gender , political , and sports groups . indeed , the number and variety are unlimited . the fundamental problem for organizations is to recognize that personal and group identifications may either facilitate or obstruct correct decision making for the organization . a specific organization has to determine deliberately , and specify in appropriate detail and clear language , its own goals , objectives , means , ends , and values.simon has been critical of traditional economics ' elementary understanding of decision-making , and argues it `` is too quick to build an idealistic , unrealistic picture of the decision-making process and then prescribe on the basis of such unrealistic picture '' .herbert simon rediscovered path diagrams , which were originally invented by sewall wright around <year> . === artificial intelligence === simon was a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence , creating with allen newell the logic theory machine ( <year> ) and the general problem solver ( gps ) ( <year> ) programs . gps may possibly be the first method developed for separating problem solving strategy from information about particular problems . both programs were developed using the information processing language ( ipl ) ( <year> ) developed by newell , cliff shaw , and simon . donald knuth mentions the development of list processing in ipl , with the linked list originally called `` nss memory '' for its inventors . in <year> , simon predicted that computer chess would surpass human chess abilities within `` ten years '' when , in reality , that transition took about forty years.in the early 1960s psychologist ulric neisser asserted that while machines are capable of replicating `` cold cognition '' behaviors such as reasoning , planning , perceiving , and deciding , they would never be able to replicate `` hot cognition '' behaviors such as pain , pleasure , desire , and other emotions . simon responded to neisser 's views in <year> by writing a paper on emotional cognition , which he updated in <year> and published in psychological review . simon 's work on emotional cognition was largely ignored by the artificial intelligence research community for several years , but subsequent work on emotions by sloman and picard helped refocus attention on simon 's paper and eventually , made it highly influential on the topic.simon also collaborated with james g. march <days> several works in organization theory.with allen newell , simon developed a theory for the simulation of human problem solving behavior using production rules . the study of human problem solving required new kinds of human measurements and , with anders ericsson , simon developed the experimental technique of verbal protocol analysis . simon was interested in the role of knowledge in expertise . he said that to become an expert on a topic required about ten years of experience and he and colleagues estimated that expertise was the result of learning roughly 50,000 chunks of information . a chess expert was said to have learned about 50,000 chunks or chess position patterns.he was awarded the acm turing award , along with allen newell , in <year> . `` in joint scientific efforts extending over twenty years , initially in collaboration with j. c. ( cliff ) shaw at the rand corporation , and subsequentially [ sic ] with numerous faculty and student colleagues at carnegie mellon university , they have made basic contributions to artificial intelligence , the psychology of human cognition , and list processing . '' === psychology === simon was interested in how humans learn and , with edward feigenbaum , he developed the epam ( elementary perceiver and memorizer ) theory , one of the first theories of learning to be implemented as a computer program . epam was able to explain a large number of phenomena in the field of verbal learning . later versions of the model were applied to concept formation and the acquisition of expertise . with fernand gobet , he has expanded the epam theory into the chrest computational model . the theory explains how simple chunks of information form the building blocks of schemata , which are more complex structures . chrest has been used predominantly , to simulate aspects of chess expertise . === sociology and economics === simon has been credited for revolutionary changes in microeconomics . he is responsible for the concept of organizational decision-making as it is known today . he was the first to rigorously examine how administrators made decisions when they did not have perfect and complete information . it was in this area that he was awarded the nobel prize in 1978.at the cowles commission , simon 's main goal was to link economic theory to mathematics and statistics . his main contributions were to the fields of general equilibrium and econometrics . he was greatly influenced by the marginalist debate that began in the 1930s . the popular work of the time argued that it was not apparent empirically that entrepreneurs needed to follow the marginalist principles of profit-maximization/cost-minimization in running organizations . the argument went on to note that profit maximization was not accomplished , in part , because of the lack of complete information . in decision-making , simon believed that agents face uncertainty about the future and costs in acquiring information in the present . these factors limit the extent to which agents may make a fully rational decision , thus they possess only `` bounded rationality '' and must make decisions by `` satisficing '' , or choosing that which might not be optimal , but which will make them happy enough . bounded rationality is a central theme in behavioral economics . it is concerned with the ways in which the actual decision making process influences decision . theories of bounded rationality relax one or more assumptions of standard expected utility theory . further , simon emphasized that psychologists invoke a `` procedural '' definition of rationality , whereas economists employ a `` substantive '' definition . gustavos barros argued that the procedural rationality concept does not have a significant presence in the economics field and has never had nearly as much weight as the concept of bounded rationality . however , in an earlier article , bhargava ( <year> ) noted the importance of simon 's arguments and emphasized that there are several applications of the `` procedural '' definition of rationality in econometric analyses of data on health . in particular , economists should employ `` auxiliary assumptions '' that reflect the knowledge in the relevant biomedical fields , and guide the specification of econometric models for health outcomes . simon was also known for his research on industrial organization . he determined that the internal organization of firms and the external business decisions thereof , did not conform to the neoclassical theories of `` rational '' decision-making . simon wrote many articles on the topic over the course of his life , mainly focusing on the issue of decision-making within the behavior of what he termed `` bounded rationality '' . `` rational behavior , in economics , means that individuals maximize their utility function under the constraints they face ( e.g. , their budget constraint , limited choices , ... ) in pursuit of their self-interest . this is reflected in the theory of subjective expected utility . the term , bounded rationality , is used to designate rational choice that takes into account the cognitive limitations of both knowledge and cognitive capacity . bounded rationality is a central theme in behavioral economics . it is concerned with the ways in which the actual decision-making process influences decisions . theories of bounded rationality relax one or more assumptions of standard expected utility theory '' .simon determined that the best way to study these areas was through computer simulations . as such , he developed an interest in computer science . simon 's main interests in computer science were in artificial intelligence , human–computer interaction , principles of the organization of humans and machines as information processing systems , the use of computers to study ( by modeling ) philosophical problems of the nature of intelligence and of epistemology , and the social implications of computer technology.in his youth , simon took an interest in land economics and georgism , an idea known at the time as `` single tax '' . the system is meant to redistribute unearned economic rent to the public and improve land use . in <year> , simon still maintained these ideas and argued that land value tax should replace taxes on wages.some of simon 's economic research was directed toward understanding technological change in general and the information processing revolution in particular . === pedagogy === simon 's work has strongly influenced john mighton , developer of a program that has achieved significant success in improving mathematics performance among elementary and high school students . mighton cites a <year> paper by simon and two coauthors that counters arguments by french mathematics educator , guy brousseau , and others suggesting that excessive practice hampers children 's understanding : [ the ] criticism of practice ( called `` drill and kill , '' as if this phrase constituted empirical evaluation ) is prominent in constructivist writings . nothing flies more in the face of the last <integer> years of research than the assertion that practice is bad . all evidence , from the laboratory and from extensive case studies of professionals , indicates that real competence only comes with extensive practice ... in denying the critical role of practice one is denying children the very thing they need to achieve real competence . the instructional task is not to `` kill '' motivation by demanding drill , but to find tasks that provide practice while at the same time sustaining interest . == awards and honors == simon received many top-level honors in life , including becoming a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences in <year> ; election as a member of the national academy of sciences in <year> ; apa award for distinguished scientific contributions to psychology ( <year> ) ; the acm 's turing award for making `` basic contributions to artificial intelligence , the psychology of human cognition , and list

rational decision-making in business organizations william tinsley keeton ( february <days> , <year> – august <days> , <year> ) was an american zoologist known internationally for his work on animal behavior , especially bird migration , and for his work on millipede taxonomy . he was a well-liked professor of biology at cornell university in ithaca , new york and author of a widely used introductory textbook , biological science . == biography == william keeton was born february <days> , <year> , in roanoke , virginia , and grew up in lynchburg . keeton attended the university of chicago and received both his bachelor of arts and the bachelor of science degrees , working under dr. alfred e. emerson . keeton earned a master 's degree at virginia polytechnic institute ( virginia tech ) , during which he revised the millipede genus brachoria . during his time at virginia tech , keeton met barbara orcutt , whom he married in <year> . he moved to cornell university in <year> in order to continue his research with millipede systematics for his doctorate , where he studied under dr. howard e. evans . his doctoral research culminated in a monograph on the family spirobolidae . he received his doctorate in <year> and joined the biology faculty at cornell university as a biology professor in <year> . keeton was a noted and well-known biological science <integer> professor beginning in <year> , so much so that his popularity as a professor earned his class the nickname of the `` keeton course '' . in addition to his teaching keeton is known for his work with pigeons and bird orientation and navigation , as he studied pigeon homing behaviors for well over a decade . during his early work at cornell university the biological science departments were reorganized , and as a result william keeton moved from the entomology department to the newly created neurobiology and behavior department . it was here where he first started his research on pigeon homing , which led him to the discoveries of the effects of the earth 's magnetic field , the position of the sun , as well as olfactory navigation and visual cues involved in the process that pigeons use to find their way home . cornell university built keeton a loft large enough to house two thousand pigeons that were the subjects of keeton 's experiments on the behaviors and processes involved in pigeon homing . both students and faculty at cornell university , as well as other scientists from around the world came and worked alongside william keeton in his pigeon loft.william keeton is also known for his work in writing the biology textbook named biological science , that was first published by the w.w. norton & company in <year> . it took keeton approximately five years to write the first edition of the textbook . it went through three editions before his death in <year> . after keeton 's death the textbook was revised for editions <integer> , <integer> , and <integer> by james l. gould ( and carol gould ) . the textbook was a combination of both botany and zoology . this combination of sciences turned out to be extremely successful in teaching many aspects of biology . the textbook was one of the first that integrated zoology and botany and sought common themes , guided by the process of evolution.keeton died from heart attack on august <days> , <year> , due to a failure of a mechanical heart valve . he was <integer> years old . == work with pigeons == william keeton had always had a fascination with pigeon homing techniques from the time he was a child . when he was nine years old he received his first homing pigeons which he raced and trained with his friends . many scientists held speculative ideas about the techniques that pigeons might be using , including the use of the position of the sun , the earth 's magnetic field , landmark recognition and olfactory navigation . william keeton tested these various speculations throughout his time at cornell university . === magnetic interference === in william keeton 's <year> magnets interfere with pigeon homing paper , william keeton proved that pigeons were affected by changes in the magnetic field surrounding them , and that pigeons were using the earth 's magnetic field as one way of finding their way home . in this experiment , william keeton attached magnets to the back of pigeons just before they were released and measured their vanishing point ( in what direction they had flown out of sight ) and the time it took to find their way home for both the experimental birds and with the control birds ( control birds had a piece of brass glued to their back of the same weight as the magnet ) . keeton 's results showed that when the sun was visible , the magnets would not usually prevent the birds from finding their way home , but when the sky was overcast the birds with magnets on their back were much more unsuccessful and slower at finding their way back home than the control birds . previous scientists had shown that pigeons were not relying entirely on the sun to navigate home as many scientists had speculated , when they found that many pigeons were able to navigate successfully under completely overcast skies . this notion led keeton to question whether the pigeons were using the earth 's magnetic field to orient themselves and navigate home successfully . keeton 's experiments with magnets showed that there was a combination of processes being used by the pigeons to navigate home , but the use of the earth 's magnetic field was very important for pigeon orientation and navigation . under clear skies with the sun visible , both the birds with magnets and the birds without magnets had little trouble navigating back to the loft , yet at unfamiliar locations with overcast skies the birds with magnets glued to their backs were unable to successfully orient themselves and navigate back to the loft . keeton speculated that this was occurring because the birds without magnets were able to use the earth 's magnetic fields to orient themselves in the correct direction , whereas the birds with magnets attached to their backs were unable to use the sun , familiar landmarks , or the earth 's magnetic fields to find their way home . this discovery was extremely useful in explaining one of the most interesting questions of bird navigation . === olfactory interference === many scientists hypothesized that pigeons were using olfactory information as part of the process in finding their way back to the loft . in italy , a study by n.e . baldaccini , in which the bills of pigeons were applied with a strong odor , showed results that the pigeons had less accurate initial orientation . baldaccini also performed an experiment in which he reared pigeons in a loft in which the wind was deflected by <integer> degrees . baldaccini 's results showed that a deflection in the wind while the pigeons were young proved to have an effect on their initial orientation after being released . keeton replicated this experiment but found that there was a smaller deflection than the results in baldaccini 's experiment in italy . keeton speculated that there may <days> an effect on initial orientation based on an olfactory map , but the experiment was too general for proving that this was indeed what was occurring in this experiment . === bibliography of

to study sex hormones of the octopus . it was here that he first saw lampbrush chromosomes , which became his lifetime obsession.his studies in naples were interrupted by the second world war . mick initially joined the raf , rising from flight lieutenant to squadron leader , as a highly competent airman . he was then transferred into radar research and operation . after the war , then newly

harsányi jános károly ; may <days> , <year> – august <days> , <year> ) was a hungarian nobel prize laureate economist . he moved to the united states in <year> , and spent most of his life there . he is best known for his contributions to the study of game theory and its application to economics , specifically for his developing the highly innovative analysis of games of incomplete information , so-called bayesian games . he also made important contributions to the use of game theory and economic reasoning in political and moral philosophy ( specifically utilitarian ethics ) as well as contributing to the study of equilibrium selection . for his work , he was a co-recipient along with john nash and reinhard selten of the <year> nobel memorial prize in economic sciences . according to györgy marx , he was one of the martians . == early life == harsanyi was born on may <days> , <year> , in budapest , hungary , the son of alice harsányi ( née gombos ) and károly harsányi , a pharmacy owner . his parents converted from judaism to catholicism a year before he was born . he attended high school at the lutheran gymnasium in budapest . in high school , he became one of the best problem solvers of the kömal , the mathematical and physical monthly for secondary schools . founded in <year> , this periodical is generally credited with a large share of hungarian students ' success in mathematics . he also won the first prize in the eötvös mathematics competition for high school students.although he wanted to study mathematics and philosophy , his father sent him to france in <year> to enroll in chemical engineering at the university of lyon . however , because of the start of world war ii , harsanyi returned to hungary to study pharmacology at the university of budapest ( today : eötvös loránd university ) , earning a diploma in <year> . as a pharmacology student , harsanyi escaped conscription into the royal hungarian army which , as a person of jewish descent , would have meant forced labor . however , in <year> ( after the fall of the horthy regime and the seizure of power by the arrow cross party ) his military deferment was cancelled and he was compelled to join a forced labor unit on the eastern front . after seven months of forced labor , when the german authorities decided to deport his unit to a concentration camp in austria , john harsanyi managed to escape and found sanctuary for the rest of the war in a jesuit house . == postwar == after the end of the war , harsanyi returned to the university of budapest for graduate studies in philosophy and sociology , earning his phd in both subjects in <year> . then a devout catholic , he simultaneously studied theology , also joining lay ranks of the dominican order . he later abandoned catholicism , becoming an atheist for the rest of his life . harsanyi spent the academic year 1947–1948 on the faculty of the institute of sociology of the university of budapest , where he met anne klauber , his future wife . he was forced to resign the faculty because of openly expressing his anti-marxist opinions , while anne faced increasing peer pressure to leave him for the same reason . harsanyi remained in hungary for the following two years attempting to sell his family 's pharmacy without losing it to the authorities . after it became apparent that the communist party would confiscate the pharmacy in <year> , he fled with anne and her parents by illegally crossing the border into austria and then going to australia where klauber 's parents had some friends . == australia == the two did not marry until they arrived in australia because klauber 's immigration papers would need to be changed to reflect her married name . the two arrived with her parents on december <days> , <year> , and they looked to marry immediately . harsanyi and klauber were married on january <days> , <year> . neither spoke much english and understood little of what they were told to say to each other . harsanyi later explained to his new wife that she had promised to cook better food than she usually did.harsanyi 's hungarian degrees were not recognized in australia , but they earned him credit at the university of sydney for a master 's degree . harsanyi worked in a factory during the day and studied economics in the evening at the university of sydney , finishing with a m.a . in <year> . while studying in sydney , he started publishing research papers in economic journals , including the journal of political economy and the review of economic studies . the degree allowed him to take a teaching position in <year> at the university of queensland in brisbane . while in brisbane , harsanyi 's wife became a fashion designer for a small factory . == later years == in <year> , harsanyi received a rockefeller scholarship that enabled him and anne to spend the next two years in the united states , at stanford university and , for a semester , at the cowles foundation . at stanford harsanyi wrote a dissertation in game theory under the supervision of kenneth arrow , earning a second phd in economics in <year> , while anne earned an ma in psychology . harsanyi 's student visa expired in <year> and the two returned to australia . after working for a short time as a researcher at the australian national university in canberra , harsanyi became frustrated with the lack of interest in game theory in australia . with the help of kenneth arrow and james tobin , he was able to move to the united states , taking a position as professor of economics at the wayne state university in detroit between <year> and <year> . in <year> , he moved to berkeley , california ; he remained at the university of california , berkeley , until retiring in <year> . shortly after arriving in berkeley , he and anne had a child , tom . while teaching at berkeley , harsanyi did extensive research in game theory . harold kuhn , who had been john von neumann 's student in princeton and already had games theory publications encouraged him in this . the work for which he won the <year> nobel prize in economics was a series of articles published in <year> and <year> which established what has become the standard framework for analyzing `` games of incomplete information '' , situations in which the various strategic decisionmakers have different information about the parameters of the game . he resolved the problem of how players could make decisions while not knowing what each other knows by modelling the situation with initial moves by nature using known probabilities to choose the parameters , with some players observing nature 's move but other players just knowing the probabilities and the fact that some players have observed the actual realized values . this relies on assuming that all players know the structure of the game , which means they all have `` common priors '' , knowing the probabilities nature uses in selecting parameters values , an assumption known as the harsanyi doctrine.from <year> to <year> , harsanyi was part of a team of game theorists tasked with advising the united states arms control and disarmament agency in collaboration with mathematica , a consulting group from princeton university led by harold kuhn and oskar morgenstern.john harsanyi died on august <days> , <year> , from a heart attack in berkeley , california , after he suffered from alzheimer 's disease . == publications == harsanyi began researching utilitarian ethics in the mid-fifties at the university of queensland in brisbane . this led to two publications explaining why , before understanding moral problems , the difference between people 's personal and moral preferences must be distinguished . as he says at the beginning of his essay included in the book edited by a. sen and b. williams ( see below ) , he tries to reconcile three traditions of western moral thinking , those of adam smith , immanuel kant and the utilitarians ( bentham , mill , sidgwick and edgeworth ) . he is considered one of the most important exponents of the `` rule utilitarianism '' . after moving to the usa on a rockefeller fellowship where he was supervised by kenneth arrow , harsanyi was influenced by nash 's publications on game theory and became increasingly interested in the topic . harsanyi , john c. <days> october

as he was not going to publish the research results . ) in <year> , granger also wrote an article on `` the typical spectral shape of an economic variable '' , which appeared in econometrica in <year> . both the book and the article proved influential in the adoption of the new methods . granger also became a full professor at the university of nottingham . in a <year> paper in econometrica , granger also introduced his concept of granger causality . after reading a pre-print copy of the time series book by george box and gwilym jenkins in <year> , granger became interested in forecasting . for the next few years he worked on this subject with his post-doctoral student , paul newbold ; and they wrote a book which became a standard reference in time series forecasting ( published in <year> ) . using simulations , granger and newbold also wrote the famous <year> paper on spurious regression which led to a re-evaluation of previous empirical work in economics and to the econometric methodology.granger spent <integer> years at the university of nottingham . in <year> , the building that houses the economics and geography departments was renamed the sir clive granger building in honor of his nobel prize award . in <year> granger moved to the university of california at san diego . in <year> he participated in a us bureau of census committee , chaired by arnold zellner , on seasonal adjustment . at ucsd , granger continued his research on time series , collaborating closely with nobel prize co-recipient robert engle ( whom he helped bring to ucsd ) , roselyne joyeux ( on fractional integration ) , timo teräsvirta ( on nonlinear time series ) and others . working with robert engle , he developed the concept of cointegration , introduced in a <year> joint paper in econometrica ; for which he was awarded the nobel prize in <year> . granger also supervised many phd students , including mark watson ( co-advisor with robert engle ) .in later years granger also used time series methods to analyse data outside economics . he worked on a project forecasting deforestation in the amazon rainforest . in <year> , granger retired from ucsd as a professor emeritus . he was a visiting eminent scholar of the university of melbourne and canterbury university . he was a supporter of the campaign for the establishment of a united nations parliamentary assembly , an organisation which campaigns for democratic reform of the united nations.granger was married to patricia ( lady granger ) from <year> until his death . he is survived by their son , mark william john , and their daughter , claire amanda jane.granger died on <integer> may <year> , at scripps memorial hospital in la jolla , california . == honors and awards == in <year> , granger and his collaborator robert engle were jointly awarded the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences . he was made a knight bachelor in the new year 's honours in 2005.granger was a fellow of the econometric

volodymyr antonovych ivashko ; <integer> october <year> – <integer> november <year> ) was a soviet ukrainian politician , briefly acting as general secretary of the communist party of the soviet union ( cpsu ) during the period from <integer> to <integer> august <year> . on <integer> august mikhail gorbachev resigned from the post , and on <integer> august the cpsu was suspended by the supreme soviet . before becoming general secretary he had been voted gorbachev 's deputy general secretary within the party on <integer> july <year> , a newly created position as a result of the 28th congress of the communist party . == background == the communist party of the soviet union ( cpsu ) during the time between mikhail gorbachev 's resignation and its suspension was politically impotent . by the time of the 28th congress <days> july <year> , the party was largely regarded as being unable to lead the country and had , across the fifteen republics of the soviet union , split into opposing factions favouring either independent republics or the continuation of the soviet state . stripped of its leading role in society , the party lost its authority to lead the nation or the cohesion that kept the party united . actual political power lay in the positions of president of the soviet union ( held by gorbachev ) and president of the russian sfsr ( held by boris yeltsin ) . during the august coup he did not make public statements but on behalf of the secretariat distributed letters to local party organizations calling on them to uphold the cpsu . gorbachev brought in his ally ivashko in to replace the long-serving volodymyr shcherbytsky as first secretary of the ukrainian communist party on <integer> september <year> . ivashko led the communists to victory in the first relatively free parliamentary election held in the ukrainian ssr , which took place from <integer> march <days> <integer> march <year> , the communists winning <integer> seats to the democratic bloc 's <integer> seats . ivashko was elected by the communist majority to the post of the chairman of the verkhovna rada of the ukrainian ssr on <integer> june <year> . since the abandonment by the communists of their `` leading role '' in early <year> this position now superseded that of first secretary of the communist party as the most powerful position in ukraine . he resigned his position as first secretary on <integer> june <year> following opposition demonstrations against his simultaneous occupation of both the posts of first secretary of the ruling party and chairman of the legislature . however , on <integer> july <year> he too resigned as chairman of the verkhovna rada of the ukrainian ssr after declining to be recalled to kyiv during the 28th congress of the communist party in moscow , and a few days later successfully secured the position of deputy general secretary of the cpsu . on august <days> , <year> , a secret memorandum from ivashko outlined strategies to hide the communist party 's assets through russian and international joint ventures because boris yeltsin , who was the new president of the russian republic in the soviet union , wanted to levy taxes on the communist party 's vast administrative property holdings and on the party itself . the memorandum was to organize the transfer of cpsu funds , cpsu financing and support of its operations through associations , ventures , foundations , etc . which are to act as invisible economics . <days> november <year> , the offshore structure fimaco was formed by the russian central bank , then known as gosbank , to hide these funds . according to sergei tretyakov , kgb chief vladimir kryuchkov sent us $ <integer> billion worth of funds of the communist party to an unknown location in the lead-up to the collapse of the ussr.ivashko retired in <year> and died on <integer> november <year> , at the age of <integer> , after an undetermined long illness . == notes == == references == ==

protozoologist noted for his work on testing the effectiveness of chemical compounds in treating tropical diseases . he was born in london to a shoe shop manager , and became interested in nature thanks to holidays spent with his grandfather , a gamekeeper , and his uncle , a pharmacist . he was educated at william ellis school before being accepted into university college london to study botany and zoology . after graduating he went to the college of the pharmaceutical society and studied pharmacy , graduating in <year> . he became a demonstrator at the college under j h burn and at his urging took further degrees in medicine and physiology . the start of world war ii saw the college evacuated , leaving goodwin to find a new job . he started work at the wellcome bureau of scientific research but was called up for military service with the royal tank regiment soon afterwards . after only a few days of training he was returned to wellcome to work on tropical diseases , something considered 'vital war work ' which excused him from military service . one of the important problems he was dealing with at the time was trying to find a way of preventing troops being infected with leishmaniasis , which was affecting large numbers of troops in sicily at the time . the standard way of calculating the dosage of drug to give a person was the 'chemotherapeutic index ' , an index between the minimum dosage to cure an infection and the point at which the drug would kill the patient . goodwin 's attempt at refining the index by testing the drugs on european hamsters failed because they were already resistant to leishmaniasis ; instead he got a scientist in jerusalem to send him some syrian hamsters to test the drugs on.the research showed that pentostam was the least toxic and most effective drug available to treat the disease , and it was issued to troops within a year . goodwin later claimed that the syrian hamsters used as pets in the united kingdom were for the most part descended from the colony he had bred , and credited himself with introducing the use of hamsters as pets . he continued working at the wellcome bureau of scientific research until <year> , when he became director of the wellcome laboratories of tropical medicine . in <year> he became head of the nuffield laboratories for comparative medicine , staying there until <year> . during this time he conducted research into anticoagulants , trypanosomiasis ( sleeping sickness ) and arteriosclerosis . in <year> he was elected a fellow of the royal society , and in the <year> new

<year> – july <days> , <year> ) was an american professor of neuroscience , neurology , psychiatry and psychology at yale university school of medicine . she pioneered multidisciplinary research of the prefrontal cortex and working memory . == early life and education == patricia shoer was born in salem , massachusetts . her father , irving shoer , was the son of latvian immigrants and her mother , jenny pearl , was a russian immigrant . she grew up in peabody , massachusetts and attended peabody high school . goldman-rakic earned her bachelor 's degree cum laude in neurobiology from vassar in <year> , and her doctorate from the university of california at los angeles in experimental developmental psychology in 1963.after postdoctoral positions at ucla and new york university , goldman-rakic worked at the national institute of mental health in neuropsychology and later as chief of developmental neurobiology from <other> . she moved to yale school of medicine in <year> where she remained until her death . she was the eugene higgins professor of neuroscience in the neurobiology department with joint appointments in the departments of psychiatry , neurology , and psychology . in <year> she was granted a five-year , $ <integer> million grant to establish the center for neuroscience research at yale . == research == goldman-rakic was the first to discover and describe the circuitry of the prefrontal cortex and its relationship to working memory . previously , scientists thought that the higher cognitive functions of the prefrontal cortex were beyond the scope of scientific study . goldman-rakic 's research showed that methods employed to study the sensory cortices could be adapted to the highest order prefrontal cortical areas , revealing the circuit basis for higher cognitive function . because of goldman-rakic , scientists began to better understand the neurobiological basis of higher cognitive function , and of such disorders as schizophrenia , alzheimer 's , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( adhd ) , cerebral palsy , parkinson 's disease , and dementia . she used a multidisciplinary approach , applying biochemical , electrophysiological , pharmacological , anatomical and behavioral techniques to study working memory . she pioneered the first studies of dopamine influences on prefrontal cortical function , research that is critical to our understanding of schizophrenia , adhd and parkinson 's disease . a review of her life 's work , including her special role mentoring women scientists , can be found in neuron.goldman-rakic co-authored over <integer> scholarly articles and co-edited <integer> books . she co-founded the cerebral cortex journal , a specialized publication by oxford press , with her husband dr. pasko rakic . early in her career , she studied the capacity of the brain to repair itself in early development , and was one of the first to use radioactive tracers to examine this phenomenon.she used microelectrode recording in her research and challenged the traditional notion that memory was not controlled or involved in the frontal lobe ; she asserted that working memory was in its own structure apart from long-term memory . == personal life == goldman-rakic had two sisters , dr. ruth rappaport , her identical twin , and dr. linda faith schoer . she was married to dr. lawrence goldman . she re-married pasko rakic , also a neuroscientist , in <year> . == death == on july <days> , <year> , goldman-rakic was struck by a car while crossing a street in hamden , connecticut . she died two days later , on july <days> at yale-new haven hospital . she is buried in grove street cemetery.in memory or goldman-rakic , constance and stephen lieber created the goldman-rakic prize for outstanding achievement in cognitive neuroscience to celebrate her memory and her discoveries about the brain 's frontal lobe . this prize is awarded every year to outstanding scientists , from psychiatrist to molecular neuroscientist , for their impact on the study of cognition . the prize carries an award of $ 40,000 and the winners are honored at the annual international awards dinner in new york city . == honors and awards == goldman-rakic was also the president of the society for neuroscience from <other> and a fellow of the american psychological association . ==

physician at the children 's hospital in zürich . in <year> was the beginning of his career as pediatric endocrinologist . his advanced research brought him to the u.s. in the early 1950s ; prader specialized at the bellevue hospital , new york city under the guidance of l.e . holt , jr , son of luther emmett holt . his lasting interests in endocrinology was attributed to his contacts with lawson wilkins . prader received his doctorate in <year> . in <year> , he became professor at the medical faculty at the zurich university . in <year> the long term department chief guido fanconi retired and prader succeeded him as professor and chairman of the department of pediatrics at the university of zürich . he also took over the post of director of the children ’ s hospital ( kinderspital ) and remained in these posts until <year> . == studies == andrea prader 's fundamental studies were in pediatric endocrinology , however in his earlier works there are other topics in the field of pediatrics . here are some of his works and collaborations listed in chronological order : pediatric cardiology , with ettore rossi ( <year> ) endocrine and metabolic disorders medical genetics ( <year> ) pathophysiology of steroid hormones – including intersex-conditions and defects of the steroid synthesis ( <year> ) . he also devised the eponymous prader scale , used to describe

the mental research institute and lived and worked in palo alto , california . == early life and education == paul watzlawick was born in villach , austria in <year> , the son of a bank director . after he graduated from high school in <year> , watzlawick studied philosophy and philology at the università ca ' foscari venice – even though the faculty of philosophy was not established before <year> – and earned a phd ( doctor of philosophy degree ) in <year> . he then studied at the carl jung institute in zurich , where he received a degree in analytical psychology in <year> . in <year> he continued his research career at the university of el salvador . == career == in <year> , don . d. jackson arranged for him to go to palo alto to do research at the mental research institute ( mri ) . starting in <year> he taught psychiatry at stanford university . at the mental research institute watzlawick followed in the footsteps of gregory bateson and the research team ( don d. jackson , john weakland , jay haley ) responsible for introducing what became known as the `` double bind '' theory of schizophrenia . double bind can be defined as a person trapped under mutually exclusive expectations . watzlawick 's <year> work based on bateson 's thinking , pragmatics of human communication ( with don jackson and janet beavin ) , became a cornerstone work of communication theory . other scientific contributions include works on radical constructivism and most importantly his theory on communication . he was active in the field of family therapy . watzlawick was one of the three founding members of the brief therapy center at mri . in <year> , members of the center published a major work on their brief approach , change , principles of problem formation and problem resolution ( watzlawick , weakland , fisch ) . he was licensed as a psychologist in california from <year> until <year> , when he stopped seeing patients . == personal life == watzlawick was married ( vera ) and had two stepdaughters ( yvonne and joanne ) . a cardiac arrest at his home in palo alto caused his death at the age of <integer> . == work == === interactional view === watzlawick did extensive research on how communication is effected within families . watzlawick defines five basic axioms in his theory on communication , popularly known as the `` interactional view '' . the interactional view is an interpretive theory drawing from the cybernetic tradition . the five axioms are necessary in order to have a functioning communication process and competence between two individuals or an entire family . when it comes to this theory , miscommunication happens because all of the communicators are not `` speaking the same language '' . this happens because people have different viewpoints of speaking . its principles are cybernetic , its causality is of a circular , feedback nature , and , with information being its core element , it is concerned with the processes of communication within systems of the widest sense—and therefore also with human systems , e.g. , families , large organizations and even international relations . the communication within the `` interactional view '' is based on what is happening , and not necessarily associated with who , when , where , or why it takes place . `` normal '' as well as the `` disturbed '' family is studied in order to infer conditions conducive to the approach of interaction-orientation . it is believed that individual personality , character , and deviance are shaped by the individual 's relations with his fellows . thus , symptoms , defenses , character structure and personality can be seen as terms describing the individual 's typical interactions which occur in response to a particular interpersonal context . the whole is more than the sum of its parts , and it is that whole in which we are interested . === five basic axioms === the interactional view requires a network of communication rules that govern a family homeostasis , which is the tacit collusion of family members to maintain the status quo . even if the status quo is negative it can still be hard to change . interactional theorists believe that we will fail to recognize this destructive resistance to change unless we understand watzlawick 's axioms . the following axioms can explain how miscommunication can occur if all the communicators are not on the same page . if one of these axioms is somehow disturbed , communication might fail . all of these axioms are derived from the work of gregory bateson , much of which is collected in steps to an ecology of mind ( <year> ) .watzlawick , beavin bavelas and jackson support these axioms to maintain family homeostasis . one can not not communicate : every behavior is a form of communication . because behavior does not have a counterpart ( there is no anti-behavior ) , it is impossible not to communicate . even if communication is being avoided ( such as the unconscious use of non-verbals or symptom strategy ) , that is a form of communication . `` symptom strategy '' is ascribing our silence to something beyond our control and makes no communication impossible . examples of symptom strategy are sleepiness , headaches , and drunkenness . even facial expressions , digital communication , and being silent can be analyzed as communication by a receiver . every communication has a content and relationship aspect such that the latter classifies the former and is therefore a metacommunication : all communication includes , apart from the plain meaning of words , more information . this information is based on how the speaker wants to be understood and how he himself sees his relation to the receiver of information . relationship is the command part of the message or how it is non-verbally said . content is the report or what is said verbally . being able to interpret both of these aspects is essential in understanding something that a communicator said . the relational aspect of interaction is known as metacommunication . metacommunication is communication about communication . relationship messages are always the most important element in communication . the nature of a relationship is dependent on the punctuation of the partners ' communication procedures : both the sender and the receiver of information structure the communication flow differently and therefore interpret their own behavior during communicating as merely a reaction on the other 's behavior ( i.e. , every partner thinks the other one is the cause of a specific behavior ) . to punctuate a communication means to interpret an ongoing sequence of events by labeling one event as the cause and the following event as the response . in a situation with communication , if one thing happens , something else always happens . for example , a female in a relationship with a male is feeling depressed . the male in the relationship with the female feels guilty . one who observes this situation might ask , `` is she depressed because of his guilt , or does he feel guilty because of her depression ? '' human communication involves both digital and analog modalities : this axiom refers back to the use of non-verbals and system strategy explained in the first axiom . it is mostly related to the digital content of communication within a relationship . inter-human communication procedures are either symmetric or complementary : this axiom focuses on metacommunication with two main components called symmetrical interchange and complementary interchange . symmetrical interchange is an interaction based on equal power between communicators . in accordance to that , complementary interchange is an interaction based on differences in power . within these two interchanges there are three different ways they can be used : one-up , one-down , and one-across . with a one-up communication , one communicator attempts to gain control of an exchange by dominating the overall communication . a one-down communication has the opposite effect . a communicator attempts to yield control of an interaction or submit to someone . the final message is a one-across communication . this communication moves to neutralize a situation . this is also called transitory if only one communicator is attempting this style . when two communicators use the same style of one-up , one-down , or one-across , it is symmetrical . if they are opposing one another it is complementary . this axiom allows us to understand how an interaction can be perceived by the styles a communicator is using . === additional notions === some interrelated notions that make up the interactional view promoted by watzlawick and colleagues at the mri include : one can not not communicate , and the related idea that one can not not influence ; understanding behavior as if we are constantly exchanging messages defining the nature of relationships of which we are a part ; shifting focus of attention from intent to the effects of behavior as communication ; observer-imposed punctuation ; emphasizing the vital role of the therapist 's preconceptions in bringing forth socially constructed reality ; investing the ramifications of self-fulfilling prophecy ; and articulating and fully embracing the `` as if '' nature of behavior.a term that is used often in the theory of the interactional view is enabler . an enabler is within addiction culture ; a person whose non-assertive behavior allows others to continue in their substance abuse . an example of this would be a person letting their sibling continue to act in an immature manner because that is what the family is used to him doing . another word frequently used in the interactional view is double-bind . someone in a double-bind , is a person trapped by expectations ; the powerful party requests that the low-power party act symmetrically . an example of this would be a person asking another person , `` why did n't you like the movie ? '' or `` you like rock 'n ' roll , do n't you ? '' the first person is asking the second person to act in a way that is similar ( symmetrical ) to them . === criticisms === the critique of this theory can be centered on one main thing : the application of the theory as a whole . being able to take these axioms and apply them to relationships between families can be very difficult to master . it can be said that this theory is trapped because it is so hard to apply . also , the theory itself does not claim and exact applications other than `` reframing '' . reframing asks the communicators to step outside of the situation and reinterpret what it means . this can be hard because the theory states that only an outside source can see a problem because people are `` speaking their own language '' . this theory also shows how a relationship has already changed , but it does not give practical ways to go about changing it . this system resists change and it can be hard to actively use the five axioms . related to the first axiom , non-verbal communication can be viewed as informative rather than communicative . with the behavioral characteristic of equifinality involved , it is hard to know when the system of the interactional view is happening or not . equifinality is the systems theory assumption that a given outcome could have occurred due to any or many interconnected factors rather than being a result in a cause—effect relationship . this theory rests on the word communication , but this word can be interpreted very differently between people . the definitions of communication can be very controversial . overall , the axioms do a great job of explaining problems , but do not provide solutions to the problems they bring up . this critique does fail however to acknowledge watzlawick 's influence on the development of brief therapy , a hugely important and influential school of psychotherapy which is only too practical and usable in helping people make changes . == publications == watzlawick wrote <integer> books that were translated into <integer> languages for academic and general audiences with more than <integer> scientific articles and book chapters . books he has written or on which he has collaborated include : an anthology of human communication , <year> pragmatics of human communication ( with beavin and jackson ) , <year> , oclc <integer> change : principles of problem formation and problem resolution ( with john weakland and richard fisch ) , <year> , oclc <integer> , w w norton page how real is real ? , <year> , oclc <integer> the language of change , <year> , oclc <integer> , w w norton page gebrauchsanweisung für amerika , <year> the situation is hopeless , but not serious : the pursuit of unhappiness , <year> , oclc <integer> , w w norton page the invented reality : how do we know what we believe we know ?

march <days> , <year> – june <days> , <year> ) was an israeli cognitive and mathematical psychologist and a key figure in the discovery of systematic human cognitive bias and handling of risk . much of his early work concerned the foundations of measurement . he was co-author of a three-volume treatise , foundations of measurement . his early work with daniel kahneman focused on the psychology of prediction and probability judgment ; later they worked together to develop prospect theory , which aims to explain irrational human economic choices and is considered one of the seminal works of behavioral economics . six years after tversky 's death , kahneman received the <year> nobel memorial prize in economic sciences for the work he did in collaboration with amos tversky . ( the prize is not awarded posthumously . ) kahneman told the new york times in an interview soon after receiving the honor : `` i feel it is a joint prize . we were twinned for more than a decade . `` tversky also collaborated with many leading researchers including thomas gilovich , itamar simonson , paul slovic and richard thaler . a review of general psychology survey , published in <year> , ranked tversky as the 93rd most cited psychologist of the 20th century , tied with edwin boring , john dewey , and wilhelm wundt . == early life and education == tversky was born in haifa , british palestine ( now israel ) , as son of the polish-born veterinarian yosef tversky and lithuanian jewish jenia tversky ( née ginzburg ) , a social worker who later became a member of the knesset representing the mapai ( workers ' party ) . tversky had one sister , ruth , thirteen years his senior . tversky 's mother has said he was self-taught in many areas , including mathematics . in high school , tversky took classes from literary critic baruch kurzweil , and befriended classmate dahlia ravikovich , who would become an award-winning poet . tversky received his bachelor 's degree from hebrew university of jerusalem in israel in <year> , and his doctorate from the university of michigan in ann arbor in <year> . he had already developed a clear vision of researching judgement . == military service and career == during this time he was also a member and leader in nahal , an israel defense forces program that combined compulsory military service with the establishment of agricultural settlements.tversky served with distinction in the israel defense forces as a paratrooper , rising to the rank of captain and being decorated for bravery . he parachuted in combat zones during the suez crisis in <year> , commanded an infantry unit during the six-day war in <year> , and served in a psychology field-unit during the yom kippur war in <year> . == academic career == === academic roles === after his doctorate , tversky taught at hebrew university . he then joined the faculty of stanford university in <year> , where he spent the rest of his career . === academic work === ==== work with daniel kahneman ==== amos tversky 's most influential work was done with his longtime collaborator , daniel kahneman , in a partnership that began in the late 1960s . their work explored the biases and failures in rationality continually exhibited in human decision-making . starting with their first paper together , `` belief in the law of small numbers '' , kahneman and tversky laid out eleven `` cognitive illusions '' that affect human judgment , frequently using small-scale empirical experiments that demonstrate how subjects make irrational decisions under uncertain conditions . ( they introduced the notion of cognitive bias in <year> . ) this work was highly influential in the field of economics , which had largely presumed rationality of all actors.according to kahneman the collaboration 'tapered off ' in the early 1980s , although they tried to revive it . factors included tversky receiving most of the external credit for the output of the partnership , and a reduction in the generosity with which tversky and kahneman interacted with each other . ==== comparative ignorance ==== tversky and fox ( <year> ) addressed ambiguity aversion , the idea that people do not like ambiguous gambles or choices with ambiguity , with the comparative ignorance framework . their idea was that people are only ambiguity averse when their attention is specifically brought to the ambiguity by comparing an ambiguous option to an unambiguous option . for instance , people are willing to bet more on choosing a correct colored ball from an urn containing equal proportions of black and red balls than an urn with unknown proportions of balls when evaluating both of these urns at the same time . however , when evaluating them separately , people are willing to bet approximately the same amount on either urn . thus , when it is possible to compare the ambiguous gamble to an unambiguous gamble people are averse — but not when one is ignorant of this comparison . ==== notable contributions ==== foundations of measurement anchoring and adjustment availability heuristic base rate fallacy conjunction fallacy framing behavioral finance clustering illusion loss aversion prospect theory cumulative prospect theory representativeness heuristic tversky index support theory contrast model feature matching account of similarity === approach to research === kahneman said that tversky `` had simply perfect taste in choosing problems , and he never wasted much time on anything that was not destined to matter . he also had an unfailing compass that always kept him going forward.tversky 's <year> science article with kahneman on cognitive illusions triggered a `` cascade of related research , '' science news wrote in a <year> article tracing the recent history of research on reasoning . decision theorists in economics , business , philosophy and medicine as well as psychologists cited their work . === recognition === in <year> he became a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences.in <year> he was a recipient of the macarthur fellowship , and in <year> he was elected to the national academy of sciences . tversky , as a co-recipient with daniel kahneman , earned the <year> university of louisville grawemeyer award for psychology.after tversky 's death , kahneman was awarded the <year> nobel memorial prize in economic sciences for the work he did in collaboration with tversky . nobel prizes are not awarded posthumously . == personality and characteristics == kahneman has said `` amos was the freest person i have known , and he was able to be free because he was also one of the most disciplined . `` persi diaconis , a professor of mathematics at stanford , has said `` you were happy being in his presence . there was a light shining out of him . `` gerhard casper , a professor of behavioral sciences at stanford , said tversky `` maintained the highest standards of professional ethics '' , and `` his dedication to stanford and its institutions of faculty governance was exemplary . `` whilst being very collaborative , tversky also had a lifelong habit of working alone at night while others slept.in intellectual debate tversky `` wanted to crush the opposition '' .tversky believed that humans live under uncertainty , in a probabilistic universe . == personal life == in <year> tversky married american psychologist barbara gans , who later became a professor in the human-development department at teachers college , columbia university . they had three children together . he died of a metastatic melanoma in 1996.he was a jewish atheist . == in popular culture == === tversky intelligence test === as recounted by malcolm gladwell in <year> 's david and goliath : underdogs , misfits , and the art of battling giants , tversky 's peers thought so highly of him that they devised a tongue-in-cheek one-part test for measuring intelligence . as related to gladwell by psychologist adam alter , the tversky intelligence test was `` the faster you realized tversky was smarter than you , the smarter you were .

<integer> may <year> – <integer> february <year> ) was a slovenian liberal politician , president of the presidency of yugoslavia ( 1989–1990 ) , prime minister of slovenia ( 1992–2002 , with a short break in <year> ) and president of slovenia ( 2002–2007 ) . == youth and early career == drnovšek was born in celje and was raised in the small town of kisovec in the municipality of zagorje ob savi , where his father viktor ( 1925–2005 ) was the local mine chief and his mother silva ( 1921–1976 ) was a homemaker . drnovšek graduated from the university of ljubljana with a degree in economics in <year> . meanwhile , he worked as an intern at a le havre bank . in <year> , at the age of <integer> , he became chief financial officer at sgp beton zagorje , a construction company . two years later he became , for one year , an economic adviser at the yugoslav embassy in cairo . he defended his master 's thesis in <year> , and in <year> , he defended his dissertation in <year> at the faculty of economics and business at the university of maribor . in <year> , he became head of the local branch of ljubljana bank in his home region of the central sava valley in central slovenia . in <year> he was chosen to be a delegate at the slovenian republic assembly ( parliament ) and also the chamber of republics and provinces of the yugoslav parliament . == membership in the yugoslav presidency == in <year> , stane dolanc , the slovenian representative to the collective presidency of yugoslavia , retired . the slovenian communist party , aware of upcoming democratisation , decided to organize elections between two candidates for the position . drnovšek , until then rather unknown to the public , defeated marko bulc , the party 's preferred candidate . the communist leaderships of other yugoslav republics did not agree with this new way of selecting the representative to the collective presidency , so the slovenian republic parliament had to confirm the result of the elections . drnovšek served as chairman of the collective presidency from 1989–90 . while he was chairman of the presidency , he was also chairman of the non-aligned movement and the commander of the yugoslav people 's army . until the end of communist rule he was an active member of the communist party . after the democratic changes in slovenia , the country seceded from yugoslavia . following the ten day war , drnovšek used his position in the collective presidency to help mediate the brioni agreement and to negotiate a peaceful withdrawal of yugoslav army from slovenia . == prime minister of slovenia == in <year> , after a government crisis in the demos coalition , which had won the first democratic elections in slovenia in <year> and led the country to independence , drnovšek became the second prime minister of independent slovenia . he was chosen as a compromise candidate and an expert in economic policy . his bi-partisan government was supported both by the left and centrist wing of the dissolved demos coalition ( the social democratic party of slovenia , the democratic party and the greens of slovenia ) and by three parties that derived from organizations of the former communist regime ( the liberal democratic party , the party of democratic reform and the socialist party of slovenia ) . shortly afterwards , drnovšek was elected president of the liberal democratic party ( liberalno demokratska stranka – lds ) , the legal successor of the association of socialist youth of slovenia ( zveza socialistične mladine slovenije – zsms ) , the youth fraction of the communist party of slovenia . in <year> , the liberal democratic party under drnovšek 's leadership won the parliamentary elections , but due to a high fragmentation of the popular vote had to ally itself with other parties in order to form a stable government . despite a politically turbulent mandate ( in <year> , the social democratic party of slovenia left the coalition ) , the party gained votes in <year> , remaining the largest party in the government . nevertheless , drnovšek barely secured himself a third term in office after a failed attempt to ally himself with the slovenian national party . in <year> , the liberal democracy of slovenia formed a coalition government with the populist slovenian people 's party which finally enabled drnovšek to serve a third term in office . he headed the government until may <year> , when he stepped down due to disagreements with the slovenian people 's party . after less than six months in opposition , drnovšek returned to power in the autumn of <year> , after his party gained a clear victory in the parliamentary elections . drnovšek 's governments guided slovenia 's political and economic reconstruction . he successfully tackled the twin tasks of reorienting slovenia 's trade away from the wreckage of the old yugoslavia towards the west and replacing the ineffective communist-era business model with more market-based mechanisms . unlike the other five former yugoslav republics which were run for much of the 1990s by frequently authoritarian presidents , slovenia under drnovšek 's premiership quickly emerged from the break-up of the federation as a functioning parliamentary democracy . drnovšek 's political strategy was concentrated on broad coalitions , transcending ideological and programmatic divisions between parties . contrary to some other former communist countries in eastern europe , the economic and social transformation in slovenia pursued by drnovšek 's governments followed a gradualist approach.drnovšek was a staunch supporter of slovenia 's entry in the european union and nato and was largely responsible for slovenia 's successful bid for membership in both of those organizations . as prime minister , he was frequently active on foreign policy issues . on <integer> june <year> , he helped to arrange the first meeting of the u.s. president george w. bush with the russian president vladimir putin , which was held in the upper carniolan estate of brdo pri kranju . ( bush-putin <year> ) in <year> , he ran for president of slovenia , and was elected in the second round , defeating the center-right candidate barbara brezigar . == president of slovenia and the change in lifestyle == drnovšek 's presidency was highly controversial . in the first three years in office , he rarely appeared in public , save for the most important official duties . in <year> , however , a change of style became visible . he launched several campaigns in foreign policy , such as a failed humanitarian mission to darfur and a proposal for the solution of the political crisis in kosovo . on january <days> , <year> , he left the liberal democracy of slovenia . shortly afterwards , he founded the movement for justice and development and became its first president . he claimed this was not meant to be a political movement , but rather a wide initiative , aiming to `` raise human consciousness and make the world a better place '' . on june <days> , <year> , he announced that he would not be running for a second term in an interview on tv slovenia . === conflict with the government === the <year> legislative election brought further changes and a political swing to the right . janez janša , the leader of a right-wing coalition , formed the new government . in slovenia , this was the first time after <year> that the president and the prime minister had represented opposing political factions for more than a few months . between <other> , the relationship between president drnovšek and janez janša , then leader of the opposition , were considered more than good and in the first year of cohabitation , no major problems arose . in the beginning of his term , drnovšek , who was ill with kidney cancer , stayed out of public view . when he reemerged in late <year> he had already changed his lifestyle : he had become a vegan ( though one of his colleagues in a televised interview mentioned their regular sunday visits to a pizzeria in maxi market , ljubljana ) , moved out of the capital into the countryside , and withdrew from party politics completely , ending his already frozen membership in the liberal democracy . drnovšek 's new approach to politics prompted one political commentator to nickname him `` slovenia 's gandhi '' .the relationship between drnovšek and the government quickly became tense . disagreements began with drnovšek 's initiatives in foreign politics , aimed at solving major foreign conflicts , including those in darfur and kosovo . initially , these initiatives were initially not openly opposed by the prime minister janez janša , but were criticized by the foreign minister dimitrij rupel , drnovšek 's former collaborator and close political ally until 2004.a major clash between the two happened in summer <year> , when disagreement arose over drnovšek 's attempt to intervene in the darfur conflict . the disagreements moved from issues of domestic politics <days> october <year> , when drnovšek publicly criticised the treatment of the strojans , a romani family whose neighborhood had forced them to relocate , which in turn had subjected them to police supervision and limitation of movement.the disagreements however escalated when the parliamentary majority repeatedly rejected president 's candidates for the governor of the bank of slovenia , beginning with the rejection of incumbent mitja gaspari . the friction continued over the appointment of other state official nominees , including constitutional court judges . although the president 's political support suffered after his personal transformation , the polls nevertheless showed public backing of the president against an increasingly unpopular government.the tension reached its apex <days> may <year> , when the newly appointed director of the slovenian intelligence and security agency matjaž šinkovec unclassified several documents from the period before <year> , revealing , among other , that drnovšek had used secret service funds for personal purposes between <other> . the president reacted with a harsh criticism of the government 's policies , accusing the ruling coalition of abusing its power for personal delegitimations and labeled the then current prime minister janez janša as `` the leader of the negative guys '' in the last months in office , drnovšek continued his attacks on prime minister janez janša , who mostly remained silent on the issue . drnovšek accused janša of `` fostering proto-totalitarian tendencies '' . he became a blogger ( janez d ) , signing his posts as `` janez d '' and expressing opinions on various issues from foreign policy , environmentalism , human relationships , religion , animal rights and personal growth . in his last months in office , he withdrew to a reclusive life again , devoting his time to the movement for justice and development and the popularization of his lifestyle and views . === lifestyle changes === during his time in office as the president of slovenia , he wrote and published several books in spiritual philosophy , including misli o življenju in zavedanju ( `` thoughts on life and consciousness '' ) , zlate misli o življenju in zavedanju ( `` golden thoughts on life and consciousness '' ) , bistvo sveta ( `` the essence of the world '' ) , and his last one called pogovori or dialogues . according to his own accounts , it took him only two or three weeks to write each of his books , due to – in his words – `` the higher consciousness '' he was able to access . his lifestyle was a mixture of elements from various traditions , including hindu religious thought and the non-attachment of buddhist philosophy . he also valued the indigenous traditions of the world . for example , he was present at the inauguration of evo morales , the first native american president of bolivia , and later hosted bolivian ethnic musicians in the presidential palace in ljubljana . after his cancer diagnosis , drnovšek became a vegan and claimed that this greatly improved his health.because of his new lifestyle and the content of his books and blogs , he was often regarded as an adherent of the new age movement , although he rejected such a qualification as being too narrow . == personal life == drnovšek was fluent in six languages , slovene , serbo-croatian , english , spanish , french and german . he was divorced with one son , jaša , who is a translator and journalist . in <year> , he found out about the existence of a daughter , nana forte , otherwise a renowned composer . his sister is helena drnovšek zorko , who has been the slovenian ambassador in japan since september <year> . === death === in <year> , drnovšek had kidney cancer resulting in the removal of a kidney . in <year> , he had cancerous formations on his lungs and liver . he repeatedly claimed nature was the best cure , and spent most of his days at his home in zaplana . he died there on february <days> , <year> ,

industrialism and industrial man ( <year> , joint author ) ; labor and the american community ( <year> , with derek c. bok ) ; dispute resolution , negotiation and consensus building ( <year> ) ; and the management of labor unions ( <year> ) . == career == === early life and education === dunlop was born in placerville in northern california , where his family owned a pear orchard . devoted presbyterian missionaries , his parents moved to the philippines when dunlop was four years old , the eldest of a family that grew to seven children . he was raised and educated on the island of cebu , and remained there until graduating from high school . then , dunlop returned to the united states with his older brother to enroll in college . dunlop was initially rejected from the university of california , berkeley because of his unusual background and instead enrolled at marin junior college in <year> . dunlop later transferred to the university of california , berkeley , where he graduated summa cum laude in <year> . he remained there for his doctorate in economics , where he produced the dissertation `` movements of wage-rates in the business cycle '' ( <year> ) . while studying at berkeley , dunlop met with his wife , dorothy emily webb ; they married on july <days> , <year> . that year , dunlop went to cambridge university on a fellowship in order to study under john maynard keynes . at the time , dunlop lived near john kenneth galbraith , who later became a colleague at harvard.although dunlop 's intention was to study with keynes during the fellowship , the elder 's poor health limited their interaction . nonetheless , dunlop 's study of wage setting in the cotton mill industry based on fieldwork conducted during that visit led him to publish a major paper in the economic journal in <year> demonstrating a problem in keynes ' depiction of wage rigidity in the seminal work the general theory of employment , interest , and money ( <year> ) . in a laudatory note published with dunlop 's paper , keynes acknowledged the correction and the contribution of the paper . === professorial career === dunlop was shortly after offered a teaching fellowship at harvard university 's economics department that he maintained throughout the rest of his life . he was tenured in <year> and became a full professor at harvard in <year> . he later chaired the department of economics between <year> and <year> , and was dean of the faculty of arts and sciences between <year> and <year> . dunlop was named lamont university professor in <year> . dunlop focused on wage determination and the role of markets and institutions in their determination . he wrote a series of articles in economic journals regarding the role of unions in wage setting , arguing that unions focused on balancing wage gains in collective bargaining against their employment effects . he also explored the impact of product market forces on the level of wages , arguing that neoclassical models of wage determination underplayed the important ( and sometimes idiosyncratic ) role of product markets . in <year> , he brought together his scholarly work on wage determination with applied experience in dispute resolution in his seminal book industrial relations systems . the book proposed a model of how an `` industrial relations system '' brings together product market , regulatory , and technological factors with the institutional practices of labor and business to produce wages , benefits , and other workplace outcomes . several decades of scholarly debate followed its publication . he subsequently collaborated with clark kerr , frederick harbison , and charles myers on cross-national studies of the evolution of industrial relations systems , resulting in the book industrialism and industrial man in 1960.dunlop trained several generations of doctoral students in the course of his career at harvard . in the <other> , students included academics who became prominent industrial relations specialists , labor historians , and labor economists , including irving bernstein , david brody , morris horowitz , mark leiserson , william miernyk , herbert northrup , jean pearlson , martin segal , jack stieber , lloyd ulman , and donald white . his students in the 1960s—80s went on to distinguished careers in labor and health economics , including katharine abraham , kim clark , peter doeringer , richard b. freeman , jack hirshleifer , carol jones , garth mangum , daniel quinn mills , joseph newhouse , michael piore , james scoville , paula voos , michael wachter , and david weil . he collaborated with many other academics in a variety of fields including frederick abernathy , derek bok , ray goldberg , james healy , larry katz , clark kerr , george shultz , and arnold zack . along with his scholarly activities at harvard , he was deeply involved in the creation of many programs and innovations at the university . in <year> , dunlop , along with professors sumner slichter and james healy , co-founded the harvard trade union program , only the second executive program at harvard ( the first being the neiman fellows program in journalism ) that continues to provide training to senior leaders in the labor movement in the us and around the world . he taught in this program from its founding until his death in <year> . an unnamed colleague told reporter daniel q. haney of the associated press that dunlop is `` more at home with a plumbers ' convention than with the harvard faculty . he even sort of looks like a plumber , the way he always wears bow ties . '' he also helped to found in <year> the harvard joint center for housing studies . he played significant roles in the early days of the harvard kennedy school of government , and served as the acting director of its center for business and government from <year> to <year> . dunlop also played an active role in solving problems at the university . during a critical period in its history following the police bust in <year> and subsequent shutdown of the university , dunlop played a crucial role in restoring stability to the institution , leading a student faculty committee through a process to resolve the conflict and ultimately to introduce governance reforms . following nathan pusey 's resignation as president , he then served as dean and as a close advisor to president derek bok during the tumultuous period of the vietnam war , settling disputes between students , faculty , and the harvard administration . bok commented `` he probably saved this university at a very critical time after the student riots in <other> '' with `` leadership and a cool head . `` many years later , following a highly contentious series of organizing efforts , a new union was elected at harvard to represent clerical and technical workers . in light of the acrimony that accompanied harvard 's campaign against unionization , harvard president derek bok tapped dunlop to lead the university 's management negotiation team . dunlop negotiated with the president of the newly formed harvard union of clerical and technical workers union , kris rondeau , what is widely regarded as an innovative collective bargaining agreement that focuses on problem solving and staff engagement . the agreement remains in effect today , the ninth contract currently being negotiated in <year> . dunlop remained on the harvard faculty his entire life , taking emeritus status in <year> . even after retirement , he remained active in research and teaching including leading newly established freshmen seminars at the age of <integer> . === impact in washington === dunlop began his work in washington during world war ii . on january <days> , <year> , president franklin roosevelt issued executive order <year> instating the national war labor board ( nwlb ) . charged with settling labor / management disputes in exchange for a no-strike agreement , the nwlb arbitrated disputes across major industries . because of its centrality in setting wages and benefits in a climate of military mobilization , limited resources , inflationary pressure , the nwlb 's staff and leadership received a rapid-fire introduction to the problems and challenges confronting hundreds of enterprises . from <year> to <year> , dunlop held the post of chief of the research and statistics branch of the nwlb and the experience helped him develop his fact-finding approach to resolving disputes . several other nwlb alumni became major figures in the field of industrial relations including clark kerr , the future chancellor and president of the university of california , and benjamin aaron , director of the ucla institute of industrial relations from <year> to <year> . derek bok , former president of harvard university , commented in <year> that dunlop `` ... was the last surviving member of a small group of people who came of age during world war ii who had the respect of both business and labor . `` in the war 's aftermath , president harry truman selected dunlop for the atomic energy labor panel . between <year> and <year> , he chaired the national joint board for the settlement of jurisdictional disputes in the building and construction industry . he served on the wage stabilization board from <year> to <year> , experience that would decades later encourage the nixon administration to put him in charge of efforts to oversee setting wages and price controls . in <year> , dunlop replaced donald h. rumsfeld as director of the cost of living council . == political life == <days> march <year> , president gerald ford selected dunlop as his first secretary of labor . dunlop focused on a variety of efforts that sought to bring the idea of multi-party problem solving to the regulatory process , and in implementing labor policies . his views on the importance of government policy in fashioning agreements among parties rather than through direct regulatory authority were laid out in his article `` the limits of legal compulsion '' . in that article , dunlop notes : the country needs to acquire a more realistic understanding of the limitations on bringing about social change through legal compulsion . a great deal of government time needs to be devoted to improving understanding , persuasion , accommodation , mutual problem solving , and information mediation . legislation , litigation , and regulations are useful means for some social and economic problems , but today government has more regulation on its plate than it can handle . the desire to bring parties together to solve problems led dunlop to resign as secretary of labor . the construction industry remained an ongoing focus of dunlop due to its important role in the us economy and particularly the potential of collective bargaining agreements in that industry to have inflationary pressures in the larger economies . building trades unions sought changes in the national labor relations act ( nlra ) to reflect the distinctive problems of that sector in regard to rules regarding union recognition , organizing and the rights to picket . through ongoing negotiations between trade union leaders and leading contractors and construction end users , dunlop crafted an agreement between the parties that would amend the nlra in ways sought by unions in exchange for their agreement along with management to longer term industry reforms , in a bill that would move in tandem through congress . after brokering the deal and receiving support from ford , the common situs legislation was passed by congress . however , facing stiff opposition from a surging ronald reagan in the republican primaries of <year> and a more assertive republican right wing , ford reneged on dunlop 's pledge and vetoed the legislation . <days> january <year> , dunlop resigned as secretary of labor.dunlop served subsequent administrations . in <year> , president jimmy carter appointed dunlop the chair of the pay advisory committee . between <year> and <year> , dunlop belonged to president reagan 's national productivity advisory committee , while from <year> to <year> he served on president george h.w . bush 's social security advisory council . in <year> , the clinton administration named dunlop the chair of the commission on the future of worker management relations ( soon known as the dunlop commission ) . the commission was established to examine the need for reform of the national labor relations act and related federal laws regarding workplace representation and recommend changes to them . differences among commission members and the midterm election of <year> that brought a republican majority to the house of representatives thwarted action on many of the dunlop commission 's recommendations . dunlop nonetheless went on to work on promoting negotiated rulemaking for workplace health and safety and crafted an agreement between the occupational safety and health administration , the national association of home builders and the building trades council ( afl-cio ) regarding health and safety standards for residential construction . === dispute resolution in multiple fields === along with his service in government , dunlop practiced dispute resolution in a variety of other areas , pioneering innovative multi-party agreements in a variety of areas . in agriculture , he intervened in an eight-year-old dispute between the campbell soup company , the farm labor organizing committee ( floc , an afl-cio affiliate that organized farm workers in the midwest ) and tomato growers in michigan and ohio regarding conditions of work among the migrant workers who worked for growers supplying campbell 's with tomatoes . since agricultural workers are exempted from the nlra , private sector employers are not obligated to recognize unions . in addition , the farm workers were treated as independent contractors to the individual growers supplying campbell soup . growers contended that the prices received for their tomatoes precluded increases in wages or provision of better housing conditions in labor camps . in <year> , campbell soup approached dunlop to assist them in settling the dispute . dunlop brought together the parties and fashioned an agreement ending the corporate campaign in exchange for union representation among tomato growers , including a mechanism for union recognition and dispute resolution through a commission chaired by dunlop and an equal number of representatives of labor and growers . the agreement also provided growers higher prices in exchange for agreement to bargaining with the union . as a result , the agreement created a private system of union recognition , collective bargaining and dispute resolution accepted by the parties . the agreement soon expanded to include pickle growers and the food processors vlasic and dean foods and has been renewed consistently to the present . in <year> , an agreement between floc and the north carolina growers association extending the dunlop agricultural commission model was signed providing the only collective bargaining agreement covering guest workers from mexico.in <year> , dunlop and harvard university colleague frederick h. abernathy ( gordon mckay research professor of mechanical engineering and abbott and james lawrence research professor of engineering ) , a professor of fluid mechanics , were commissioned by the amalgamated clothing and textile workers union to undertake a summer study of the competitiveness of the men 's suit industry . the study focused on the need to encourage research and development on the creation ( and later the adoption ) of technology in the textile and clothing sector . eventually dunlop 's and abernathy 's efforts led to the creation of the tailored clothing and technology corporation [ tc ] <integer> , a government-business-labor organization , funded cooperatively the three parties . [ tc ] <integer> initially funded development of new technologies for the industry . it later turned to a broader focus on encouraging the use of existing technology among clothing manufacturers and textile producers . [ tc ] <integer> is discussed in the commentary of dunlop , industrial relations systems , revised edition ( boston , ma : harvard business school press , <year> ) , pp . 36–37 . in <year> , [ tc ] <integer> changed its name to the textile and clothing technology corporation to reflect its expanded mission . the group , now based in raleigh , north carolina , remains active in this area . a final area of innovative dispute resolution arose in dunlop 's home state of massachusetts . following a growing number of disputes and walkouts among police and firefighters in the 1970s , dunlop mediated an agreement between police and firefighter local unions , an association of municipal governments , and state legislators on legislation to create a tri-partite ( labor , public management , with an impartial third party chair , nominated by the two sides and appointed by the governor ) dispute resolution body to handle collective bargaining problems in the sector . the legislation was passed in <year> creating the joint labor management committee ( jlmc ) . the vast majority of the more than <year> disputes handled by the jlmc in its history were done through mediation rather than the final step which imposed a settlement on the municipal executive where the dispute occurred ( but not on the legislative body , such as city council or town meeting that appropriates funds ) . == legacy == dunlop produced a considerable body of articles , books , reports , and scholarship , with his work industrial relations systems ( <year> ) regarded as his biggest achievement . thomas kochan , the george maverick bunker professor of management at the mit sloan school of management , commented that this `` seminal book ... set the framework for scholarly analysis of our field for decades and became the focal point for debates over how relationships among labor , management , and government were structured and evolved over time . `` the historian ronald schatz of wesleyan university reflects on dunlop and his generation of industrial relations ( ir ) specialists : ... the ir professors ... were not only academics but public figures as well . many arbitrated disputes for the biggest firms and unions in the country and chaired government boards , and as time passed the leading figures in the field were appointed to be the presidents and deans of the nation 's most prestigious universities – berkeley , ann arbor , wisconsin , harvard , columbia , northwestern , princeton . one became the leading liberal in the u.s. senate ( paul douglas ) , another the watergate special prosecutor ( archibald cox ) , another the secretary of state ( george shultz ) . throughout his career in academics and the applied world , dunlop attempted to apply lessons learned in his early experience in settling disputes at the nwlb to other venues . drawing on his training in economics and his own industrial relations system framework and his insistence on having the parties agree on a common set of facts , he helped establish both a theoretical and a practical method of resolving problems and creating institutions for their ongoing evolution . in his introduction to a reissuing of his book industrial relations systems in <year> , dunlop wrote : in response to inquiries as to why i have not chosen previously to comment on the substantial literature still in currency on industrial relations systems , i have often responded that the analytical system was to be viewed as a tool to be used in analysis and problem solving . i find it useful and use it regularly in my practitioner 's role . if someone else does not find it helpful , so be it ; i am interested in any analytical framework that helps to resolve real problems . so tell me yours . he continued that work until late in his life . dunlop died in <year> in boston . there are two lecture series delivered at harvard university in honor of john t. dunlop , including <integer> ) the john t. dunlop memorial forum sponsored by the harvard trade union program where he taught for sixty years and <integer> ) the john t. dunlop lecture hosted annually by the joint center of housing studies of harvard university and supported with funds from the national housing endowment.in addition , harvard 's graduate school of design has an endowed professorship in dunlop 's name ( john t. dunlop professor in housing and urbanization ) , which was first given to rahul mehrotra in <year> . == selected works == wage determination under trade unions , <year> , <year> . collective bargaining : principles and

psychotherapeutic researcher.grawe grew up in hamburg and graduated there in psychology in <year> . he worked at the psychiatric clinic in hamburg-eppendorf between <year> and <year> and was awarded a phd in <year> from the university of hamburg . he received his habilitation in hamburg in <year> and was offered a professorship at the university of bern , switzerland . he later moved to zurich . in <other> he was president of the society for psychotherapy research . his best known and most referenced works are process and outcome in psychological therapy , psychological therapy , and neuropsychotherapy . his <year> meta-analysis on the outcomes of psychotherapy studies was the most comprehensive and ambitious in germany , and triggered a heated debate in academic circles as well as in the wider community about the efficacy and effectiveness of various approaches and psychotherapy in general . in his scientific studies , grawe asked fundamental questions such as : how does the therapeutic process develop ? which ingredients make a good psychotherapy beyond the limits of schools of psychotherapy ? how can we best train psychotherapists for their demanding tasks ? his later contributions focused on the integration of the new emerging fields of neurobiology and the brain sciences with clinical psychology and psychotherapy , becoming a father figure to contemporary neuropsychotherapy . == selected publications == == references == richard m. goodwin ( february <days> , <year> – august <days> , <year> ) was an american mathematician and economist . == background == goodwin was born in new castle , indiana . he received his ba and phd at harvard and taught there from <year> until <year> . he fled the united states during the mccarthy era , then taught at the university of cambridge until <year> and the university of siena until <year> . although he became a university lecturer in the cambridge faculty of economics and politics in <year> , it was not until five years later that he agreed to join the fellowship of a college , choosing that of peterhouse . christopher calladine thinks that this unusual situation may have been because goodwin initially had ideological opposition to the notion of the college system , which <days> may have considered to be anachronistic . later , after retiring from cambridge , goodwin was the first non-italian professor of economics at siena.goodwin described himself as `` a lifelong but wayward marxist '' , joining the communist party of great britain while a rhodes scholar at oxford in the 1930s and then its american counterpart when he got back to the united states . however , goodwin left after the announcement of the molotov–ribbentrop pact . == work == goodwin worked on the interaction between long run growth and business cycles . his article on matrix multiplier was one of the earliest uses of the perron–frobenius theorem in economics , although his reasoning had an error that was diagnosed by frank h. hahn . he returned to the perron–frobenius theorem with his book the dynamics of a capitalist economy . goodwin 's interest in applying the theory of nonlinear systems to macroeconomics was sparked by philippe le corbeiller , who taught applied physics at harvard . following an early suggestion of le corbeiller 's , goodwin characterized the business cycle as a non-linear self-oscillation . goodwin credited le corbeiller with teaching him nonlinear dynamics while le corbeiller credited goodwin with the discovery of the two-stroke oscillator.goodwin adopted the lotka–volterra equations for the population dynamics of a predator and a prey species as the basis of the goodwin model ( or goodwin 's class struggle model ) of economic growth . in his model , employed workers have the role of predators as their wage demands squeeze profits and hence investment , causing a subsequent increase in unemployment . another model , goodwin 's non-linear accelerator , is also a model of endogenous cycles in economic activity in which the cycles do not rely on outside shocks or structurally unstable parameters . `` a growth cycle '' ( <year> ) saw goodwin utilise volterra 's equations to formalise karl marx 's theory of economic cycles . == major articles == `` multiplier effects of a balanced budget , notes '' , <year> , econometrica . ``

july <days> , <year> – october <days> , <year> ) was a canadian lawyer and politician who served as the 22nd premier of quebec from <year> to <year> and from <year> to <year> . a member of the liberal party of quebec , he served a total of just under <integer> years as premier . bourassa 's tenure was marked by major events affecting quebec , including the october crisis and the meech lake and charlottetown accords . == early years and education == bourassa was born to a working class family in montreal , the son of adrienne ( née courville ) ( 1897–1982 ) and aubert bourassa , a port authority worker . robert bourassa graduated from the université de montréal law school in <year> and was admitted to the barreau du québec the following year . on august <days> , <year> , he married andrée simard , an heiress of the powerful shipbuilding simard family of sorel , quebec . later , he studied at keble college , university of oxford and also obtained a degree in political economy at harvard university in <year> . on his return to quebec , he was employed at the federal department of national revenue as a fiscal adviser . he also worked as a professor of public finance at université de montréal and université laval . == quebec legislator == bourassa was first elected as a member of the legislative assembly of quebec ( mla ) for the riding of mercier in <year> , then won the quebec liberal party leadership election on january <days> , <year> . he positioned himself as a young , competent administrator . he chose `` <integer> <integer> jobs '' as his slogan , which emphasized that jobs creation would be his priority . bourassa felt the extensive hydro-electric resources of quebec were the most effective means of completing the modernization of quebec and sustaining job creation . he successfully led his party into government in the <year> election , defeating the conservative union nationale government and becoming the youngest premier in quebec history . == premier of quebec ( <other> ) == one of bourassa 's first crises as premier was the october crisis of <year> , in which his deputy , pierre laporte , was kidnapped and later murdered by members of the front de libération du quebec . bourassa requested that prime minister pierre trudeau invoke the war measures act , which allowed for search and arrest of anyone associated with , or thought to be associated with the flq . he further requested military assistance from the federal government , which resulted in the deployment of troops to guard vital points in montreal and assist police . the army was withdrawn on <integer> january <year> , and paul rose and some of his accomplices were found guilty of murder later that year . bourassa and trudeau often clashed over issues of federal-provincial relations and quebec nationalism , with trudeau opposing what he saw as concessions to sovereignism . <days> june <year> he participated in an attempt at constitutional reform , the victoria charter , which quickly unravelled when bourassa backed away from the proposed deal after it was strongly criticised by quebec opinion leaders for not giving quebec more powers.on <integer> october <year> , trudeau announced in the house of commons that , after much deliberation , the policy of multiculturalism would be implemented in canada . bourassa documented his strong opposition to trudeau 's policy in a letter which he released to the press on <integer> november <year> , and stated he had `` serious misgivings about the principle of the multicultural policy '' . the policy document tabled in the house `` dissociates culture from language '' , which seemed to bourassa `` a questionable basis on which to found a policy '' . bourassa declared that quebec did not accept the federal government 's approach to the principle of multiculturalism.during his time in power , bourassa implemented policies aimed at protecting the status of the french language in quebec . in <year> , he introduced bill <integer> , which declared french to be the sole official language of the province . as a result , quebec was no longer institutionally bilingual ( french and english ) , though the rights of anglophones were still protected under the british north america acts . many businesses and professionals were unable to operate under such requirements . bill <integer> angered anglophones while not going far enough for many francophones ; bourassa was vilified by both groups . bourassa initiated the james bay hydroelectric project in <year> that led to the james bay and northern quebec agreement of <year> with the cree and inuit inhabitants of the region . the bourassa government also played a major role in rescuing the <year> olympic games in montreal from huge cost overruns and construction delays . bourassa 's government became embroiled in corruption scandals . on <integer> march <year> , workers belonging to the fédération des travailleurs et travailleuses du québec union working on the <other> construction site of the james bay project rioted using their bulldozers to destroy the site they were working on while other workers set buildings afire . the riot caused $ <integer> million in damage , and was part of an extortion attempt on the part of the union boss andré `` dédé '' desjardins , who was known in quebec as the `` king of construction '' . in response to the violence at the <other> site , which confirmed long-standing rumors about thuggish practices on the part of construction unions , bourassa appointed a commission consisting of a well respected judge robert cliche , a prominent montreal labour lawyer brian mulroney and guy chevrette , the vice-president of the centrale de l'enseignement du québec , whose legal counsel was another prominent lawyer lucien bouchard to investigate corruption in the construction industry in quebec . the cliche commission as it became known held <integer> days of hearings on live tv , interviewing <integer> people from the construction industry , who testified to widespread corruption and violence in the construction industry , and to the close ties between the bourassa cabinet , the mafia and corrupt construction union bosses . bouchard had wanted to have bourassa testify before the commission , but mulroney prevented this , saying that having the premier of quebec testify before the commission would be a violation of `` executive privilege '' . nonetheless , the cliche commission established the quebec construction industry was dominated by a casual brutality with thuggish union bosses teaching union organizers how best to break legs . workers who complained about corruption on the part of their bosses had their dogs murdered and their teenage children beaten up.when the cliche commission presented its report <days> may <year> , the document was described as an exposé of `` an organized system of corruption without parallel in north america '' as the commission noted that it was political corruption that had enabled the corruption in the construction industry . in an editorial , the montreal gazette wrote about the cliche commission report : `` a devastating document . for some four years , the bourassa government worked hand in glove with gangster union leadership in the province 's construction industry . '' the cliche commission had little impact on the problem of corruption in the quebec construction industry , but turned public opinion against bourassa , whose special adviser had asked the corrupt construction unions to help the liberals win a by-election in exchange for giving firms that employed workers in the corrupt unions exclusive contracts to work on the james bay project.bourassa lost the <year> provincial election to rené lévesque , leader of the sovereigntist parti québécois , in a massive landslide brought on by the language controversy and the corruption scandals , among other things . bourassa himself was heavily defeated in his own riding by pq challenger gérald godin . he resigned as liberal party leader and accepted teaching positions in europe and the united states . he remained in political exile until he returned to politics by winning the quebec liberal party leadership election on october <days> , <year> . on june <days> , <year> , he won a by-election in bertrand . == premier of quebec ( ( 1985–1994 ) == bourassa led the plq to victory in the <year> election . however , he lost his own seat to parti québécois candidate jean-guy parent . on january <days> , <year> , he was elected in a by-election in the liberal stronghold of saint-laurent after the sitting liberal mna germain leduc resigned in his favour . during his second term as premier , bourassa invoked the notwithstanding clause of the canadian charter of rights and freedoms to override a supreme court of canada ruling that declared parts of the charter of the french language unconstitutional , causing some of his anglophone ministers to resign . a few years later , however , he introduced modifications to the language charter . these compromises reduced the controversy over language that had been a dominant feature of quebec politics over the previous decades . bourassa also pushed for quebec to be acknowledged in the canadian constitution as a `` distinct society '' , promising quebec residents that their grievances could be resolved within canada with a new constitutional deal . he worked closely with prime minister brian mulroney and received many concessions from the federal government , culminating in the meech lake accord in <year> and the charlottetown accord in <year> . the meech lake accord failed <days> june <year> when two provinces , manitoba and newfoundland , refused to ratify the agreement their premiers had signed . that failure revived the quebec separatist movement . the charlottetown accord was defeated in a nationwide plebiscite in <year> ; it was heavily defeated even in quebec , partly due to the perception that bourassa had given away too much at the negotiations . == final years == bourassa retired from politics in <year> . he was replaced as liberal leader and premier by daniel johnson jr. , who lost an election to the sovereigntist parti québécois after only nine months . in <year> , bourassa , who had spent much of his vacation time in hot climates , died in montreal of malignant melanoma at the age of <integer> , and was interred at the notre dame des neiges cemetery in montreal . == quotations == `` no matter what anyone says and no matter what anyone does , quebec is , today and forever , a distinct society , free and capable of assuming its destiny and development . '' ( watch excerpts of original speech ) ( watch english dubbing ) meech lake accord . `` there was no censorship of the press : in general , the war measures act could have been made even more radical . '' `` a diplomat had been kidnapped , a cabinet minister had been kidnapped , they were under threats of murder . the police forces were rather tired . after a whole week , we were unable to find those that had effected the kidnappings . '' `` we all have the means to be prosperous . we have to find the balance between our wealth and our needs . '' == homages == a statue and a memorial of bourassa was unveiled in front of the national assembly on october <days> , <year> . the city of quebec renamed highway du vallon , a major road in quebec city , after bourassa in late <year> . in montreal , the portion of rue university from bonaventure expressway to sherbrooke street was renamed boulevard robert-bourassa . canada 's largest hydroelectric power station , robert-bourassa generating station , and its accompanying reservoir , robert-bourassa reservoir were named after bourassa in honour of his support of the james bay project.in march <year> , a section of university street ( from notre-dame street to sherbrooke street ) in the downtown core of montreal was renamed robert-bourassa boulevard . === park avenue controversy === on october <days> , <year> , montreal mayor gérald tremblay announced that montreal 's park avenue would be named after bourassa . on november <days> the montreal city council voted in favour ( 40–22 ) of renaming park avenue after bourassa . if , as had been expected , quebec 's toponymy commission had approved the name change , all of park avenue and its continuation , bleury , would have been renamed robert bourassa avenue . this would have caused the newly named street to intersect rené lévesque boulevard , named after a long time political rival to bourassa . that boulevard , in turn , had been renamed from dorchester boulevard in <year> , in a decision that was also not without controversy . this decision by the city of montreal without any consultation with the people of the city caused an immediate controversy , though many of those opposed to the change considered it a fait accompli . the proposal spawned substantial grass-roots opposition , both because of the lack of prior citizen input and because park is itself a meaningful street name , associated with the city 's mount royal park . in addition to protests and active opposition by a committee of montreal residents and businesses opposed to the name change , an online petition garnered more than 18,000 virtual signatures against this renaming . on february <days> , <year> , montreal mayor gérald tremblay withdrew his proposal to rename park avenue . however , there is a robert bourassa blvd. , located in the duvernay district of laval , quebec . == election results (

recommendation of ragnar frisch . haavelmo was frisch 's assistant for a period of time until he was appointed as head of computations for the institute . in <year> , haavelmo studied statistics at university college london while he subsequently traveled to berlin , geneva , and oxford for additional studies . haavelmo assumed a lecturing position at the university of aarhus in <year> for one year and then in the subsequent year was offered an academic scholarship to travel abroad and study in the united states . during world war ii he worked with nortraship in the statistical department in new york city . he received his phd in <year> for his work on the probability approach in econometrics.he was a professor of economics and statistics at the university of oslo between 1948–79 and was the trade department head of division from 1947–48 . haavelmo acquired a prominent position in modern economics through his logical critique of a series of custom conceptions in mathematical analysis.in <year> , haavelmo was awarded the nobel prize in economics `` for his clarification of the probability theory foundations of econometrics and his analyses of simultaneous economic structures . `` haavelmo resided at østerås in bærum . he died on <integer> july <year> in oslo . == legacy == judea pearl wrote `` haavelmo was the first to recognize the capacity of economic models to guide policies '' and `` presented a mathematical procedure that takes an arbitrary model and produces quantitative answers to policy questions '' . according to pearl , `` haavelmo 's paper , 'the statistical implications of a system of simultaneous equations ' , marks a pivotal turning point , not in the statistical implications of econometric models , as historians typically presume , but in their causal counterparts . '' haavelmo 's idea that an economic model depicts a series of hypothetical experiments and that policies can be simulated by modifying equations in the model became the basis of all currently used formalisms of econometric causal inference . ( the biostatistics and epidemiology literature on causal inference draws from different sources . ) it was first operationalized by robert h. strotz and herman wold ( <year> ) who advocated `` wiping out '' selected equations , and then translated into graphical models as `` wiping out '' incoming arrows . this operation has subsequently led to pearl 's `` do '' -calculus and to a mathematical theory of counterfactuals in econometric models . pearl further speculates that the reason economists do not generally appreciate these revolutionary contributions of haavelmo is because economists themselves have still not reached consensus of what an economic model stands for , as attested by profound disagreements among econometric textbooks . == references == == external links == list of publications trygve haavelmo on nobelprize.org including the nobel lecture on <integer> december <year> econometrics and the welfare state model discovery and trygve haavelmo ’ s legacy by david f. hendry and søren johansen . ] trygve haavelmo growth model by elmer g. wiens `` trygve haavelmo ( 1911–1999 ) '' . the concise encyclopedia of economics . library of economics and liberty ( 2nd ed. ) . liberty fund . <year> . pearl , judea ( <year> ) . `` trygve haavelmo and the emergence of causal calculus '' ( pdf ) . forthcoming , econometric theory , special issue on haavelmo centennial . ucla computer science department , technical report <other> . chen , bryant ; pearl , judea ( <year> ) . `` regression and causation : a critical examination of six econometrics textbooks '' ( pdf ) . real-world economics review . <integer> : 2–20 . karel hendrik voous ( <integer> june <year> , huizen – <integer> january <year> , huizen ) was a dutch ornithologist and author . he was secretary-general ( 1966–1970 ) and honorary president ( 1990–1994 ) of the international ornithological committee . == bibliography == === books in english === on the history of the distribution of the genus dendrocopos ( <year> ) birds observed and collected during the whaling expeditions of the `` willem barendsz '' in the antarctic , 1946–1947 and 1947–1948 ( <year> ) owls of the northern hemisphere list of recent holarctic bird species ==== contributions ==== the ebcc atlas of european breeding birds , t & a d poyser , <year> isbn <days> ( foreword ) === books in dutch === afwijkende populatie koolmezen phylloscopus bonelli bonelli in nederland gevangen roofvogels en uilen van europa == references == `` obituary '' . british birds . <integer> ( <integer> ) : 257–259 . issn <other> . john daniel `` jack '' bergin fracp frcp ( <integer> january <year> – <integer> july <year> ) was a distinguished neurologist and catholic anti-abortion apologist . he was born in stratford , new zealand to martin bernard bergin and minni bergin ( née hignett ) . martin bergin was a barrister and solicitor in stratford . minni was a full-time mother and homemaker who died when jack was only <integer> years old , leaving a large family . jack bergin received his secondary education at st patrick 's college , silverstream , and went on to study medicine at the university of otago . he graduated with distinction in <year> , then went to serve with the new zealand medical corps at world war ii in the middle east , italy and japan . upon returning to new zealand he worked in medicine in dunedin and wellington hospitals before travelling to britain where he was a student and house physician at the royal post graduate medical school at hammersmith . he graduated from hammersmith in <year> , and received a nuffield fellowship which led to his appointment to the national hospital for nervous diseases , queen square , london . in <year> bergin returned to new zealand and succeeded dr i.m . allen as the second neurologist to wellington hospital . he was the driving force behind the establishment of neuroradiology and clinical neurophysiology , and by <year> a modern neurological department had been created . bergin also ran a private practice and for a time was visiting neurologist to wanganui and hāwera hospitals . he had long standing involvements with the home of compassion and calvary hospitals in wellington . bergin was a member of the new zealand epilepsy association council , and assisted neurological research via his participation in the scientific advisory committee of the new zealand neurological association which he helped found the neurological association of new zealand in <year> . he was also a foundation member of the australasian association of neurologists . he became a fellow of the royal australasian college of physicians in <year> , and a fellow of the royal college of physicians ( london ) in <year> . bergin was devoutly committed to the catholic faith , described by haas and hornabrook as `` able to articulate , intellectualise , and simplify aspects of catholicism , and his arguments were always persuasive '' .

<integer> july <year> – <integer> october <year> ) was a pakistani development practitioner and social scientist . he promoted participatory rural development in pakistan and other developing countries , and widely advocated community participation in development . his particular contribution was the establishment of a comprehensive project for rural development , the comilla model ( <year> ) . it earned him the ramon magsaysay award from the philippines and an honorary doctorate of law from michigan state university . in the 1980s he started a bottom-up community development initiative of orangi pilot project , based in the outskirts of karachi , which became a model of participatory development initiatives . he also directed many programmes , from microcredit to self-finance and from housing provision to family planning , for rural communities and urban slums . it earned him international recognition and high honours in pakistan . khan was fluent in at least seven languages and dialects . apart from many scholarly books and articles , he also published a collection of poems and travelogues in urdu . == early life == khan was born on <integer> july <year> in agra . he was among the four sons and three daughters of khansaahib ameer ahmed khan and mehmoodah begum . his father , a police inspector , was inspired by the reformist thinking of syed ahmed khan . in his early age , khan 's mother introduced him to the poetry of maulana hali and muhammad iqbal , the sermons of abul kalam azad , and the sufist philosophy of rumi . this upbringing influenced his interest in historical as well as contemporary social , economic , and political affairs.khan attended government high school at jalam ( uttar pradesh ) , and completed his education in <year> at agra college where he studied english literature and history . he read english literature , history , and philosophy for a bachelor of arts degree at meerut college in <year> . at that point , his mother was diagnosed with tuberculosis . she died in the same year at the age of <integer> . khan continued his studies and was awarded a master of arts in english literature from agra university in <year> . he worked as a lecturer at meerut college before joining the indian civil service ( ics ) in <year> . as part of the ics training , he was sent to read literature and history at magdalene college , cambridge , england . during the stay , he developed a friendship with choudhary rahmat ali.khan married hameedah begum ( the eldest daughter of allama mashriqi ) in <year> . together , they had three daughters ( mariam , amina , and rasheeda ) and a son ( akbar ) . after hameedah begum 's death in <year> , he married shafiq khan and had one daughter , ayesha . during his ics career , khan worked as collector of revenue , a position that brought him into regular contact with living conditions in rural areas of east bengal . the bengal famine of <year> and subsequent handling of the situation by the colonial rulers led him to resign from the indian civil service in <year> . he wrote , `` i realised that if i did not escape while i was young and vigorous , i will forever remain in the trap , and terminate as a bureaucratic big wig . '' during this period , he was influenced by the philosophy of nietzsche and mashriqi , and joined the khaksar movement . this attachment was brief . he quit the movement and turned to sufism . according to khan , `` i had a profound personal concern ; i wanted to live a life free from fear and anxiety , a calm and serene life , without turmoil and conflict . ... when i followed the advice of old sufis and sages , and tried to curb my greed , my pride and aggression , fears , anxieties and conflict diminished . `` for the next two years , khan worked in mamoola village near aligarh as a labourer and locksmith , an experience that provided him with firsthand knowledge of the problems and issues of rural communities . in <year> , he took up a teaching position at the jamia millia , delhi , where he worked for three years . in <year> , khan migrated to pakistan to teach at islamia college , karachi . in the same year , he was invited by the government of pakistan to take charge as principal of comilla victoria college in east pakistan , a position he held until <year> . during this time ( 1950–58 ) he also served as president of the east pakistan non-government teachers ' association . == rural development initiatives == during his tenure as principal of comilla victoria college , khan developed a special interest in grassroots actions . between <year> and <year> , he took a break to work as director of the village agricultural and industrial development ( v-aid ) programme . however , he was not satisfied with the development approach adopted in the programme that was limited to the training of villagers . in <year> , he went to michigan state university to acquire education and training in rural development . returning in <year> , he established the pakistan academy for rural development ( pard , eventually renamed as bangladesh academy for rural development ) at comilla on <integer> may <year> and was appointed as its founding director . khan became vice-chairman of the board of governors of pard in <year> , and in the same year , was awarded an honorary doctorate of law by michigan state university . in <year> , he established collaborative links with arthur lewis . == advisory roles == following his move to pakistan , khan was asked to implement the comilla model in rural settlements of north-west frontier province ( now khyber pakhtunkhwa ) , punjab , and sindh . he declined the offer on the grounds that the proposals were predominantly motivated by political interests rather than the common well-being . however , he continued to advise the authorities on various aspects of rural development , such as participatory irrigation management . he worked as a research fellow at the university of agriculture , faisalabad from <year> to <year> , and as director of rural economics research project at karachi university from <year> to <year> . khan went to michigan state university as a visiting professor in <year> and remained there until <year> . during this time , he carried on advising the rural development academy at bogra in northern bangladesh , and the pakistan academy for rural development , peshawar , on the daudzai integrated rural development programme . in <year> , he was appointed as a world bank consultant to survey rural development situations in java , indonesia . he also briefly worked as a visiting professor at lund university , harvard university , and the university of oxford.in <year> , khan moved to karachi and started working on the improvement of sanitary conditions in karachi suburbs . he laid the foundations of the orangi pilot project for the largest squatter community of orangi in the city . he remained associated with this project until his death in <year> . meanwhile , he maintained his support for rural communities around karachi , and also helped to develop the aga khan rural support programme . opp became a model for participatory bottom-up development initiatives . == major development programmes == === comilla cooperative pilot project === the comilla model ( <year> ) was khan 's initiative in response to the failure of a village agricultural and industrial development ( v-aid ) programme that was launched in <year> in east and west pakistan with technical assistance from the us government . v-aid remained a government-level attempt to promote citizen participation in the sphere of rural development . khan launched the project in <year> on his return from michigan , and developed a methodology of implementation in the areas of agricultural and rural development on the principle of grassroots-level participation . initially , the aim was to provide a development model of programmes and institutions that could be replicated across the country . advisory support in this respect was provided by experts from harvard and michigan state universities , the ford foundation , and usaid.comilla model simultaneously addressed the problems that were caused by the inadequacy of both local infrastructure and institutions through a range of integrated programmes . the initiatives included the establishment of : a training and development centre ; a road-drainage embankment works programme ; a decentralized , small scale irrigation programme ; and , a two-tiered cooperative system with primary cooperatives operating in the villages , and federations operating at sub-district level.after khan 's departure from comilla , the cooperative 's model failed in independent bangladesh because only a few occupational groups managed to achieve the desired success . by <year> , only <integer> of the <integer> cooperatives were functioning . the model actually fell prey to the ineffective internal and external controls , stagnation , and diversion of funds . this prompted the subsequent scholars and practitioners in microfinance , such as muhammad yunus of grameen bank and fazle hasan abed of brac , to abandon the cooperative approach in favour of more centralised control and service delivery structures . the new strategy targeted the poorest villagers , while excluding the 'less poor ' . however , khan 's leadership skills during the course of his association with the project remained a source of inspiration for these leaders , as well as other participatory development initiatives in the country . === orangi pilot project === the orangi poverty alleviation project ( known as the orangi pilot project , or opp ) was initiated by khan as an ngo in <year> . orangi is located on the northwest periphery of karachi . at that time , it was the largest of the city 's approximately <integer> low-income squatter settlements ( known as katchi abadi ) . the locality was first developed in <year> as a government township of <integer> square kilometres ( 1,236 acres ) . the influx of migrants after the creation of bangladesh swelled the settlement to about one million people crowded over an area of more than <integer> square kilometres ( 7,907 acres ) . the working class multi-ethnic population was predominantly composed of day labourers , skilled workers , artisans , small shopkeepers , peddlers and low-income white collar workers . the project proved an impetus to the socio-economic development of the population of the area . as the project director , khan proved to be a dynamic and innovative leader . the project initially focused on creating a system of underground sewers , using local materials and labour , and succeeded in laying hundreds of kilometres of drainage pipes along with auxiliary facilities . within a decade of the initiative , local residents had established schools , health clinics , women 's work centres , cooperative stores and a credit organisation to finance enterprise projects . by <year> , opp had managed to provide low-cost sewers to more than 72,000 houses . the project subsequently diversified into a number of programmes , including a people 's financed and managed low-cost sanitation programme ; a housing programme ; a basic health and family planning programme ; a programme of supervised credit for small family enterprise units ; an education programme ; and a rural development programme in the nearby villages.comparing the opp with comilla project , akhter hameed khan once commented : the orangi pilot project was very different from the comilla academy . opp was a private body , dependent for its small fixed budget on another ngo . the vast resources and support of the government , harvard advisors , msu , and ford foundation was missing . opp possessed no authority , no sanctions . <days> may observe and investigate but it could only advise , not enforce . the successful opp model became an inspiration for other municipalities around the country . in <year> , khan helped to create lodhran pilot project ( lpp ) to collaborate with lodhran municipal committee . learning from past experiences , the project extended its scope to the whole town instead of concentrating on low-income settlements only . the municipal partnership was itself a new initiative that ensured wider civic co-operation.the success of opp did come at a cost for dr khan as his liberal views and self-help initiatives were questioned and criticised by certain interest groups . at two occasions , he was accused of blasphemy . however , all allegations against him were acquitted by the courts of law and cleared by independent religious scholars . == death == in <year> , khan was visiting his family in the united states when he suffered from kidney failure . he died of myocardial infarction on <integer> october <days> indianapolis at the age of <integer> . his body was flown to karachi on <integer> october <days> where he was buried on the grounds of the opp office compound . == legacy == khan 's ideology and leadership skills were a source of inspiration for his students and colleagues , and continue to serve as guiding principles even after his death . edgar owens , who became an admirer of khan 's ideology while working at usaid 's asia bureau , co-authored a book with robert shaw as a result of observations and discussions with khan at comilla academy . a later study of various rural development experiences from south asia , edited by uphoff and cambell ( <year> ) was jointly dedicated to khan and owens.soon after khan 's death , on <integer> april <year> , the government of pakistan renamed the national centre for rural development the akhter hameed khan national centre for rural development and municipal administration.later in <year> , the council of social sciences , pakistan , in collaboration with the national rural support programme and other institutions , announced the akhter hameed khan memorial award . the annual cash award is given on khan 's birthday to a pakistani author for a book on issues related to rural and urban development , peace , poverty alleviation , or gender discrimination . at the occasion of the award ceremony in <year> , a documentary film about the life and times of akhter hameed khan was premiered . the film includes archival footage and interviews with family members , colleagues , and contributors and beneficiaries of the comilla and opp projects.the akhter hameed khan resource centre ( ahk resource center ) was established in islamabad , under the auspices of the institute of rural management , as a repository of published and digital resources on rural development . the akhter hameed khan resource center was initially formed in <year> as a repository of works and writings by khan and his mentee shoaib sultan khan ; after <year> the resource center transitioned into an ngo that established an experimental site in urban development in dhok hassu , rawalpindi . == awards and honours == khan received the following civil awards : jinnah award ( posthumous , <year> ) for services to people as founder of the orangi pilot project . nishan-e-imtiaz ( posthumous , <year> ) for services to the community . ramon magsaysay award ( <integer> august <year> , manila , philippines ) for services to rural development . sitara-e-pakistan ( <year> ) for pioneering work in rural development . == publications == khan was fluent in arabic , bengali , english , hindi , pali , persian , and urdu . he wrote several reports and monographs , mostly relating to rural development in general or his various successful and model initiatives in particular . he also published collections of poems and travelogues in urdu . === in english === <year> , bengal reminances , vol <integer> , <integer> & <integer> . comilla academy ( now the bangladesh academy for rural development ) , comilla , bangladesh . <year> , rural development in east pakistan , speeches by akhter hameed khan . asian studies center , michigan state university . <year> , institutions for rural development in indonesia , pakistan academy for rural development . karachi . <year> , rural development in pakistan . vanguard books . lahore . <year> , what i learnt in comilla and orangi . paper presented at the south asian association for regional cooperation ( saarc ) seminar . islamabad . <year> , orangi pilot project : reminiscences and reflections . the oxford university press : karachi .

. she was awarded the title hero of the soviet union on <integer> december <year> and the florence nightingale medal in <year> , making her the third soviet woman to receive the medal from the red

seriously injured , with both of her legs broken . as german soldiers ran across the battlefield she pretended to be dead , but one soldier noticed she was alive and began viciously beating her , nearly to death . a night reconnaissance platoon noticed she was still alive and managed to get her to a field hospital three days later . having suffered from severe frostbite doctors had to perform eight surgeries to save her life , amputating her left hand , entire right arm , left foot and right leg up to the knee . during the remainder of the war while she was recovering she wrote an open letter to the 1st baltic front asking them to take revenge for the suffering inflicted in her and others . in her letter she opened by stating she had been stuck in a hospital bed for <integer> months because of the axis , referring to the axis only as `` the fascists '' , briefly mentioned her life before the war but went straight to describing her anger at the axis for how she had to write with a pencil tied to the stub of her elbow , how her brother lost his hand and her husband died in the war , putting it bluntly as `` the fascists did it '' before ending the letter asking them not to spare a single german soldier to take revenge for the russian people . the letter resulted in over 3,000 letters and replies from the troops , promising revenge in her name . numerous soviet tanks and aircraft bore the text of saying things like `` this is for zinaida '' and `` for zinaida tusnolobova '' ( russian : за зину туснолобову ! ) , a practice so popular that another hero of the soviet

pursue training in medicine . in <year> llewellyn-thomas moved with his wife to montreal , where he entered mcgill medical school . while in medical school , llewellyn-thomas was employed as an electrical engineer at the montreal neurological institute where he worked with carl jasper and wilder penfield , who , at that time were engaged in their pioneering work on mapping the electrical activity of the brain . following graduation from mcgill , he interned at the queen elizabeth hospital in montreal and during that time decided to work as a general practitioner in a small community , in order to experience as much as he could of the breadth of the practice of medicine . for two years , he practiced on a small island in the bay of fundy , often traveling in a fishing boat to other islands to visit patients . working in these isolated conditions , it was often necessary to handle difficult medical cases without immediate help . it was during this time that he also worked as a research associate in the department of social psychiatry of cornell university , taking part in a major project designed to study psychiatric illness in small communities . an opportunity to work on man and the environment related to aerospace medicine attracted him , and the family moved to toronto in <year> , where he joined the defense research medical laboratory . here he initiated research into human eye movements . he also explored various aspects of aerospace medicine , psycho-pharmacology , and how man responded to his environment . along with norman h. mackworth he designed a head-mounted camera to record eye movements . he used this to study eye movements under a variety of physical conditions , such as driving an automobile , flying a small aeroplane , or perusing art . subsequent to his appointment as associate director of the then institute of biomedical electronics , a picture of a much improved version of this camera was used as the front-cover for an issue of scientific american <days> august <year> ) . in this issue , he was the author of a full description of the camera design and its application in a variety of studies that he and his graduate students

the cambridge spy ring.in <year> , rothschild gave blunt £100 to purchase `` eliezer and rebecca '' by nicolas poussin . the painting was sold by blunt 's executors in <year> for £100,000 and is now in the fitzwilliam museum.his flat in london was shared with burgess and blunt . this later aroused suspicion that he was the so-called fifth man in the cambridge spy ring . rothschild inherited his

only twice there during his life ( both speeches were in <year> , one about the pasteurization of milk , and another about the situation in palestine ) . === world war ii === rothschild was recruited to work for mi5 during world war ii in roles including bomb disposal , disinformation and espionage , winning the george medal for `` dangerous work in hazardous circumstances '' . he was the head of b1c , the `` explosives and sabotage section '' , and worked on identifying where britain 's war effort was vulnerable to sabotage and counter german sabotage attempts . this included personally

gestapo 's man in london in order to identify hundreds of nazi sympathizers . === cold war , shell and think tank === in who paid the piper ? ( <year> ) , an account of cia propaganda during the cold war , author frances stonor saunders alleges that rothschild channelled funds to encounter , an intellectual magazine founded in <year> to support the `` non-stalinist left '' in advance of us foreign policy goals . after the war , he joined the zoology department at cambridge university from <year> to <year> . he served as chairman of the agricultural research council from <year> to <year> and as worldwide head of research at royal dutch/shell from <year> to <year> . flora solomon claims in her autobiography that <days> august <year> , during a reception at the weizmann institute , she told rothschild that she thought that tomás harris and kim philby were soviet spies.when anthony blunt was unmasked as a member of the cambridge spy ring in <year> , rothschild was questioned by special branch ( though blunt was not publicly identified as a soviet agent until <year> in the house of commons by prime minister margaret thatcher ) . rothschild was cleared , and continued working on projects for the british government.rothschild was head of the central policy review staff from <year> to <year> ( known popularly as `` the think tank '' ) a staff which researched policy specifically for the government until margaret thatcher abolished it . in <year> rothschild was awarded an honorary degree from tel aviv university for `` the advancement of science , education and the economy of israel '' . it was followed in <year> by an honorary degree from jerusalem 's hebrew university . the annual `` victor rothschild memorial symposia '' is named after rothschild . === thatcher years and spycatcher === in the 1980s , rothschild joined the family bank as chairman in an effort to quell the feuding between factions led by evelyn rothschild and victor 's son , jacob rothschild . in this he was unsuccessful as jacob resigned from the bank to found j. rothschild assurance group ( a separate entity , now st. james 's place plc ) . in <year> he published an enquiry into the social science research council at the behest of sir keith joseph , a conservative minister and mentor of margaret thatcher . he continued to work in security as an adviser to margaret thatcher.he appears several times in the book spycatcher , which he hoped would clear the air over suspicions about his wartime role and the possibility he was involved in the cambridge spy ring . in early <year> tam dalyell mp used parliamentary privilege to suggest rothschild should be prosecuted for a chain of events he had `` set in train , with peter wright and harry chapman pincher '' which had led to a `` breach of confidence in relation to information on matters of state security given to authors '' .he was still able to enter the premises of mi5 as a former employee and was aware of suspicions there was a `` mole '' in mi5 , but felt himself above suspicion . while edward heath was prime minister , rothschild was a frequent visitor to chequers , the prime minister 's country residence . throughout rothschild 's life , he was a valued adviser on intelligence and science to both conservative and labour governments.in his <year> book the fifth man , australian author roland perry asserted that in <year> , after the dissolution of the soviet union , six retired kgb colonels , including yuri modin , the spy ring 's handler , alleged rothschild was the so-called `` fifth man '' : `` rothschild was the key to most of the cambridge ring 's penetration of british intelligence . `` he had the contacts '' , modin noted . `` he was able to introduce burgess , blunt and others to important figures in intelligence such as stewart menzies , dick white and robert vansittart in the foreign office ... who controlled mi6 . '' however this suggestion is rebutted by other researchers ; commentator sheila kerr pointed out that as soon as the book came out , modin denied perry 's version of their discussions ( having already stated that the fifth man was cairncross ) , and concluded that `` perry 's case against rothschild is unconvincing because of dubious sources and slack methods '' . noel annan , who was criticised by the author perry for a negative view of the latter 's book and claims , writes : `` amid clouds of misstatements he [ perry ] relies almost wholly on insinuation and bluster . ... when andrew boyle published his book and exposed blunt , why did margaret thatcher acknowledge in the house of commons the truth about blunt , but later , in the case of rothschild , clear him ? mr. perry is saying she lied to the house . he tries to make much of her curt statement , `` i am advised that we have no evidence that he was ever a soviet spy .

'' === adviser to the coal board === after the war , schumacher worked as an economic advisor to , and later chief statistician for , the british control commission , which was charged with rebuilding the german economy . from <year> to <year> he was chief economic adviser to the national coal board , one of the world 's largest organisations , with 800,000 employees . in this position , he argued that coal , not petroleum , should be used to supply the energy needs of the world 's population . he saw oil as a finite resource , fearing its depletion and eventually prohibitive price , and viewed with alarm the reality that `` the richest and cheapest reserves are located in some of the world 's most unstable countries '' .his position on the coal board was often mentioned later by those introducing schumacher or his ideas . it is generally thought that his farsighted planning contributed to britain 's post-war economic recovery . schumacher predicted the rise of opec and many of the problems of nuclear power . === thinking outside the box === in <year> schumacher travelled to burma as an economic consultant . while there , he developed the set of principles he called `` buddhist economics '' , based on the belief that individuals need good work for proper human development . he also proclaimed that `` production from local resources for local needs is the most rational way of economic life . '' he travelled throughout many third world countries , encouraging local governments to create self-reliant economies . schumacher 's experience led him to become a pioneer of what is now called appropriate technology : user-friendly and ecologically suitable technology applicable to the scale of the community ; a concept very close to ivan illich 's conviviality . he founded the intermediate technology development group ( now practical action ) in <year> . his theories of development have been summed up for many in catch phrases such as `` intermediate size '' , and `` intermediate technology '' . he was a trustee of scott bader commonwealth and in <year> the president of the soil association . e. f. schumacher was greatly influenced by mahatma gandhi and j. c. kumarappa and gandhi 's concepts of `` economy of permanence '' and appropriate technology . while delivering the gandhi memorial lecture at the gandhian institute of studies at varanasi ( india ) in <year> , schumacher described gandhi as the greatest `` people 's economist '' whose economic thinking was compatible with spirituality as opposed to materialism . === influence === schumacher was influenced by richard henry tawney , mahatma gandhi , leopold kohr , gautama buddha , karl marx , john ruskin and the catholic church throughout his life . he and his solutions to the great economic problems influence the e. f. schumacher society , the arche , george mcrobie , william schweke , and many others . == schumacher as writer == schumacher wrote on economics for london 's the times and became one of the paper 's chief editorial writers . at this post he was assigned the task of compiling information for the obituary of john maynard keynes . he also wrote for the economist and resurgence . he served as adviser to the india planning commission , as well as to the governments of zambia and burma – an experience that led to his much-read essay `` buddhist economics '' . the <year> publication of small is beautiful : a study of economics as if people mattered , a collection of essays , finished in the house of his friend leopold kohr , brought his ideas to a wider audience . one of his main arguments in small is beautiful is that we can not consider the problem of technological production solved if it requires that we recklessly erode our finite natural capital and deprive future generations of its benefits . schumacher 's work coincided with the growth of ecological concerns and with the birth of environmentalism , and he became a hero to many in the environmental movement and community movement . in <year> , he was awarded the prix européen de l'essai charles veillon for small is beautiful . his <year> work a guide for the perplexed is both a critique of materialistic scientism and an exploration of the nature and organisation of knowledge . == later life == as a young man , schumacher was a dedicated atheist , but his later rejection of materialist , capitalist , agnostic modernity was paralleled by a growing fascination with religion . he developed an interest in buddhism , but beginning in the <other> , catholicism heavily influenced his thinking . he noted the similarities between his own economic views and the teaching of papal encyclicals on socio-economic issues , from leo xiii 's `` rerum novarum '' to pope john xxiii 's mater et magistra , as well as with the distributism supported by the catholic thinkers g. k. chesterton , hilaire belloc , and vincent mcnabb . philosophically , he absorbed much of thomism , which provided an objective system in contrast to what he saw as the self-centered subjectivism and relativism of modern philosophy and society . he also was greatly interested in the tradition of christian mysticism and read deeply such writers as st. teresa of avila and thomas merton . these were all interests that he shared with his friend , the catholic writer christopher derrick . in <year> , he converted to catholicism.schumacher gave interviews and published articles for a wide readership in his later years . he also pursued one of the loves of his life : gardening . he died of a heart attack on <integer> september <year> , on arrival at billens hospital in romont , switzerland ; after falling ill on a train in zurich during a lecture tour . == legacy == schumacher 's personal collection of books and archives is held by the schumacher center for a new economics library in great barrington , massachusetts . the center continues the work of schumacher by maintaining a research library , organising lectures and seminars , publishing papers , developing model economic programs , and providing technical assistance to groups all for the purpose of linking people , land , and community to build strong , diverse local economies . === schumacher circle === the schumacher circle is a family of organisations which were founded in schumacher 's memory or were inspired by his work , and which co-operate to support each other . the circle includes the schumacher college in totnes , devon , resurgence magazine ( now resurgence & ecologist ) , publishing company green books , international non-governmental organisation practical action , the new economics foundation in the uk , the schumacher center for a new economics ( heir to the legacy programs of the former e.

– <integer> october <year> ) was a soviet and russian politician and historian . during the 1980s he was a member of the politburo and secretariat of the communist party of the soviet union . he was called the `` godfather of glasnost '' as he is considered to be the intellectual force behind mikhail gorbachev 's reform program of glasnost and perestroika . yakovlev was the first soviet politician to acknowledge the existence of the secret protocols of the <year> ribbentrop-molotov pact with nazi germany . == early career == the first child of five , yakovlev was born to a peasant family in a tiny village , korolevo , on the volga river , near yaroslavl . he had four sisters , two of whom died in infancy . his father nikolai alekseevich only attended school for four years and his mother agafiia mikhailovna , a nursemaid , for three months . yakovlev was sickly in childhood and suffered from scrofula . his father served in the red cavalry during the civil war and was fully committed to the communist regime ; he became the first chairman of a local collective farm . their house was set ablaze while he was seven and the family moved to krasnye tkachi . yakovlev graduated from secondary school days before nazi germany invaded the soviet union . he was drafted into the red army <days> november <year> , with brief training , and was promoted to lieutenant in a rifle platoon during the war . he served as a platoon commander in volkhov front . on august <days> , <year> , he was leading <integer> chuvash peasants and was ordered to charge german positions in vinyagolovo near leningrad and was badly wounded . he was hospitalized until march <year> , and almost required an amputation , but was saved at the last moment . he became a member of the communist party of the soviet union in <year> . at this time he regarded the communist party as `` life 's truth '' and affirmed he was totally loyal and faithful to soviet union , and he was an ardent admirer of stalin . <days> september <year> , he resumed education at the yaroslavl pedagogical institute to study history . on september <days> , <year> , he married nina ivanovna smirnova . he graduated the same year and went to moscow to attend the higher party school . <days> november <year> , he was appointed the instructor of the department of propaganda and agitation in yaroslavl , a post he held for a year and a half . shortly after this , he had his first doubts about the regime , when he was shocked to see train after train carrying soviet ex-prisoners-of-war being sent to labor camps . at the vspolye train station , he saw weeping women and was dismayed at how they were treated . this memory troubled him deeply and never left him . <days> march <year> , shortly after stalin 's death , he was assigned to the party 's central committee as an instructor in the department of schools . on february <days> , <year> , khrushchev 's secret speech became the most traumatic event in yakovlev 's early moscow life ; he listened to the speaker from the balcony in the large kremlin palace . after the 20th party congress , yakovlev lost his previous enthusiasm for communism and led a double life . he wanted to turn to the original sources on communism—marx , engels , lenin , german philosophers , french and italian socialists and british economists . he asked to leave the central committee to enroll in the academy of social sciences of the central committee . while twice refused , he was finally allowed to study there for two years and became convinced that marxism-leninism was hollow , impractical , and inhumane , as well as a prognostic fraud . this healed his internal political conflict following the 20th party congress . he began to agree with khrushchev.beginning in <year> , he was chosen as a fulbright exchange student at columbia university in the united states for one year . of the seventeen soviet students , fourteen were selected by the kgb . yakovlev and three others , all kgb personnel , including oleg kalugin , went to columbia . he studied intensively the english language , roosevelt and the new deal , drawing connections between the us at that time and the ussr . at the end , <days> may <year> , the soviet visitors were taken on a thirty-day tour of the us , during which he stayed with us families from vermont , chicago and iowa . as a result , he began to view perestroika as a ussr-version of the new deal to save communism , as roosevelt had saved capitalism . however , his year in america did little to assuage his anti-americanism because of the greed , racism , and other things that he witnessed . yakovlev returned to the central committee to work on ideology and propaganda , and published several anti-american books . he defended a dissertation dealing with the historiography of us foreign policy , and received the degree of kandidat nauk , the equivalent of a doctorate , <days> july <year> . <days> july <year> , he was appointed the first deputy head of the propaganda department of the central committee of the cpsu by leonid brezhnev . <days> august <year> , yakovlev was sent to prague as the representative of cpsu central committee , and witnessed the entry of tanks into the city . he later spoke out against removing dubcek . that same year , he was placed in command of a group charged with drafting the new constitution . yakovlev served as editor of several party publications and rose to the key position of head of the cpsu 's department of ideology and propaganda from <year> to <year> . <days> january <year> , he visited the us again and met ronald reagan , henry kissinger , and jane fonda , who warned him that moscow `` did not appreciate the full danger of american militarism '' . this trip , again , failed to change his unfavorable impression with us . in <year> , he took a bold stand by publishing the article entitled `` against antihistoricism '' in literaturnaya gazeta , critical of russian nationalism , and nationalism in the soviet union in general . as a result , he was removed from his position . given the choice of a diplomatic post as exile , he chose to be the ambassador to canada , remaining at that post for a decade . he arrived in canada <days> july <year> . during this time , he and canadian prime minister pierre trudeau became close friends . trudeau 's second son , alexandre trudeau , was given the russian nickname `` sacha '' after yakovlev's.from may <days> to <integer> , <year> , yakovlev accompanied mikhail gorbachev , who at the time was the soviet official in charge of agriculture , on his tour of canada . the purpose of the visit was to tour canadian farms and agricultural institutions in the hopes of taking lessons that could be applied in the soviet union . however , the two also renewed their earlier friendship and , tentatively at first , began to discuss the prospect of liberalisation in the soviet union . in an interview years later , yakovlev recalled : at first we kind of sniffed around each other and our conversations did n't touch on serious issues . and then , verily , history plays tricks on one , we had a lot of time together as guests of then liberal minister of agriculture eugene whelan in canada who , himself , was too late for the reception because he was stuck with some striking farmers somewhere . so we took a long walk on that minister 's farm and , as it often happens , both of us suddenly were just kind of flooded and let go . i somehow , for some reason , threw caution to the wind and started telling him about what i considered to be utter stupidities in the area of foreign affairs , especially about those <other> missiles that were being stationed in europe and a lot of other things . and he did the same thing . we were completely frank . he frankly talked about the problems in the internal situation in russia . he was saying that under these conditions , the conditions of dictatorship and absence of freedom , the country would simply perish . so it was at that time , during our three-hour conversation , almost as if our heads were knocked together , that we poured it all out and during that three-hour conversation we actually came to agreement on all our main points . two weeks after the visit , as a result of gorbachev 's interventions , yakovlev was recalled from canada by yuri andropov and became director of the institute of world economy and international relations of the ussr academy of sciences in moscow on august <days> , <year> ; he was succeeded by his friend yevgeny primakov in <year> . although he was impressed with canada 's free , competitive economy—especially in agriculture , the weakest part for the ussr—and the benefits of rule of law , yakovlev published a booklet called poor santa claus , or the police eye of democracy allegedly exposing canadian totalitarian practices under the pseudonym n. agashin . it described how capitalism created `` its sanitary serve - a system of repression , intimidation and terror '' , how it `` brainwashed its citizens '' , how the united states `` tyrannized its neighbor '' , and that canada was really a totalitarian police state with a democratic façade . == perestroika and its aftermath == when gorbachev became general secretary of the communist party of the soviet union in <year> , yakovlev became a senior advisor , helping to shape soviet foreign policy by advocating soviet non-intervention in eastern europe , and accompanying gorbachev on his five summit meetings with president of the united states ronald reagan . in the summer of <year> , yakovlev became head of the propaganda department of the cpsu central committee . domestically , he argued in favor of the reform programs that became known as glasnost ( openness ) and perestroika ( restructuring ) and played a key role in executing those policies . after the xx congress , in an ultra-narrow circle of our closest friends and associates , we often discussed the problems of democratization of the country and society . we chose a simple - like a sledgehammer - method of propagating the `` ideas '' of late lenin . a group of true , not imaginary reformers developed ( of course , orally ) the following plan : to strike with the authority of lenin at stalin , at stalinism . and then , if successful , - to strike with plekhanov and social democracy - at lenin , and then – with liberalism and `` moral socialism '' - at revolutionarism in general ... the soviet totalitarian regime could be destroyed only through glasnost and totalitarian party discipline , while hiding behind the interests of improving socialism . [ ... ] looking back , i can proudly say that a clever , but very simple tactic - the mechanisms of totalitarianism against the system of totalitarianism – has worked . in <year> , the russian nationalist organization pamyat sent a letter entitled `` stop yakovlev ! '' to the plenum of the central committee of the communist party of the soviet union , labelling yakovlev as the main instigator of a course of action that would lead to the 'capitulation before the imperialists'.for decades , it was the official policy of the soviet union to deny the existence of the secret protocol to the nazi–soviet pact . at the behest of mikhail gorbachev , yakovlev headed a commission investigating the existence of such a protocol . <days> december <year> yakovlev concluded that the protocol had existed and revealed his findings to the soviet parliament . as a result , the first multi-party elected congress of soviets since <year> `` passed the declaration admitting the existence of the secret protocols , condemning and denouncing them '' .he was promoted to the politburo in <year> , but by <year> he had become the focus of attacks by hardliner communists in the party opposed to liberalization . at the 28th congress of the communist party of the soviet union <days> july <year> , a cynical alexander lebed caused uproar when he asked yakovlev : `` alexander nikolaevich ... how many faces have you got ?

'' to the european congress of the regional science association in copenhagen , denmark . this paper , published in <year> , developed two concepts : the need to study the individual in order to understand social and group practices . modern cultural geographers commonly now study everyday practices on an individualistic basis , in order to understand larger scale patterns . the study of just groups creates a homogenization of reality and hides the truth . a link between space and time that had previously been poorly developed . historically , social scientists had treated time as a relevant but external factor to spatial features . hägerstrand 's early work on innovation diffusion ( studying the geographical spread of new technologies ) made him realise that the two , though separate , were not independent of each other ; they have what french theorist henri lefebvre would call a dialectical relationship . == legacy == hägerstrand 's initial work was primarily quantitative , which is important as the discipline of geography was , when he published his first paper in <year> , a highly descriptive subject . in the 1950s he was a pioneer of geocoding statistical primary data . he developed models and statistical techniques , such as the time–space cube and time–space prism , which later became important in the development of geographic information systems that process and visualize movement data . his work informed the likes of allan pred and nigel thrift , who helped take it to the english speaking world.hägerstrand 's work contributed to the introduction of humanistic thought into geography , which led to the development of critical geography . while his early work was largely quantitative , hägerstrand 's later work paid closer attention to notions of embodiment and emotion . still , his methods were critiqued by feminist geographer gillian rose , who claimed that his models showed a masculine and falsely-ordered view of the world . more recent geographers have tried to combine time geography with the qualitative research and affective phenomenology of feminist geography . development of hägerstrand 's work has continued to form part of the basis for non-representational theory , and a reappraisal of his work by new generations of social scientists and biologists means that he remains an influential thinker today . in <year> , nigel thrift summarized five benefits of hägerstrand 's time geography for contemporary social science : first , it provides a sense of concreteness , of the power of 'thereness ' , and it does so in a way—visually—that is still the preserve of too few social theorists . all those intricate diagrams were , in part , an attempt to describe the pragmatics of events , a theme which has now , in the work of writers like deleuze , become fashionable in the social sciences and humanities but , at the time at which hägerstrand was working , tended to be restricted to the field of philosophy , except for the work of social interactionists and ethnomethodologists which was often very imperfectly understood by other than a relatively small coterie of enthusiasts . secondly , hägerstrand 's work was an attack on the durkheimian idea that space and time were social categories , collective representations which both derived from society and also dictated to society . [ ... ] time-geography makes it possible to go beyond social constructionism by emphasizing the physical constraints on human action and the wider networks of competing opportunities that they set up which act to steer situations . [ ... ] thirdly , and as a directly related point , those time-geographic diagrams did something else too . they radically lessened the distinction between humans and other objects . they provided a kind of neutrality of representation , even a democracy of description , of the world . [ ... ] fourthly , hägerstrand 's work espoused a geographical ethics , centred on the wise use of space and time . although hägerstrand would often use economic metaphors to describe that wisdom in the use of space and time , i am sure that he meant something broader and more encompassing which it seems to me to be well worth keeping hold of , a kind of democratic ethos of the cardinal dimensions , a conviviality in the use of space and time . fifthly , hägerstrand provided a language which could register the world in different ways . perhaps one way of looking at hägerstrand 's work is as a means of saying 'hello ' in a language many can understand : drawing as a kind of visual esperanto . == honors == he received honorary doctorates from university of bergen , norwegian school of economics and business administration , norwegian university of science and technology , university of bristol , university of edinburgh , university of glasgow and ohio state university . the commendation accompanying the honorary degree at ohio state university noted that `` his work on innovation diffusion , carried out in the 1950s and 1960s , continues to be cited as a standard against which current research is measured '' and that `` this distinguished individual ... inspired a generation of scholars around the world . '' he was a member of the royal swedish academy of sciences , the royal swedish academy of letters , the royal swedish academy of engineering sciences , the norwegian academy of science and letters , the finnish academy of sciences , the american academy of arts and sciences , a corresponding fellow of the british academy , and a member of société de géographie in france . he was also one of the founding members of academia europaea . in <year> professor hägerstrand was awarded the charles p. daly medal of the american geographical society and in <year> received an outstanding achievement award from the association of american geographers . in <year> he received the victoria medal from the royal geographical society . in <year> torsten hägerstrand was awarded lauréat prix international de géographie vautrin lud , the highest award in the geography research field . == key publications == == see also == time geography == footnotes == == references == == further reading == == external links == `` torsten hägerstrand '' encyclopædia britannica david william snow ( <integer> september <year> – <integer> february <year> ) was a celebrated english ornithologist born in windermere , westmorland . == career and personal life == he won a scholarship to eton and started there in <year> just before his 14th birthday . he won a scholarship to study classics at new college , oxford but was called up to serve in the navy <days> april <year> and served on several ships including destroyers , frigates , and sloops . after the end of world war ii , he spent a year sailing through the far east and to australia . in <year> he returned to oxford and switched from classics to the study of zoology , earning a d.phil degree in 1953.in <year> , david married barbara kathleen whitaker , who was the warden of lundy island . barbara snow was also a noted ornithologist and a geologist . from <year> to <year> the snows worked for the new york zoological society at the society 's research centre in trinidad . here they made detailed studies of the oilbirds ( steatornis caripensis ) and the fascinating and very complex courtship dances of the white-bearded manakin ( manacus manacus ) and the golden-headed manakin ( pipra erythrocephala ) . from <year> to <year> he was the director of the charles darwin research station ( cdrs ) in the galapagos islands . he was director of cdrs during the landmark expedition mounted from the university of california at berkeley called the galápagos international scientific project ( gisp ) . he was also director of research for the british trust for ornithology from <year> to <year> , and from <year> to <year> he worked at the natural history museum . from <year> to <year> he was president of the british ornithologists ' union . david snow edited the ibis , bird study and the bulletin of the british ornithologists ' club . snow is commemorated in the name of the cotinga genus snowornis and the critically endangered alagoas antwren ( myrmotherula snowi ) . `` with his wife , barbara , snow made a huge contribution to our understanding of the evolutionary consequences of fruit-eating in birds . in a series of studies of tropical birds , he theorised that the colourful plumage and elaborate mating rituals of male manakins and similar species derived from the fact that copious supplies of fruit enabled the birds to secure adequate daily calories with only a small percentage of their time devoted to feeding . this left them plenty of opportunity to develop elaborate rituals to impress the dowdier females . in england , the snows spent five years carrying out systematic observations of fruit-eating birds in a small area on the hertfordshire-buckinghamshire borders , publishing their results in the seminal birds and berries ( <year> ) .

'' he would go on summer camping trips organized by the boy scout leader `` bugsy '' cain , and developed a circle of boyhood friends who went on to become entomologists , including robert l. usinger , judson linsley gressitt , and e. gorton linsley . at first he collected butterflies , but began to concentrate on weevils at the suggestion of a professor at the nearby university of california , berkeley . during a camping trip in <year> , he discovered a new species of weevil that became the subject of his first academic publication , in <year> , soon after enrolling in uc berkeley , where he received a b.s . degree in 1936.on the basis of his considerable field experience and his earlier work mounting specimens of hawaiian and pacific insects for the pacific entomological survey , which was then headquartered at uc berkeley , his mentors there recommended him to serve as the field entomologist on the bernice p. bishop museum 's mangarevan expedition to southeastern polynesia in <year> . his senior colleagues on that expedition gave him a new , lifelong nickname , `` zimmie , '' and his close-up encounters with a wide variety of island ecosystems gave him a new , enduring passion for biogeography.he settled in honolulu in <year> , where he worked as an entomologist for the bishop museum and conceived the idea for a single-author , multivolume insects of hawaii monograph modeled on the insects of western north america ( <year> ) by his berkeley mentor , edward oliver essig . by <year> , he had completed the first five volumes , but bishop museum director peter h. buck was more eager to publish new works in anthropology than in entomology , so zimmerman turned instead to the university of hawaiʻi , whose president , gregg m. sinclair , agreed to publish the volumes under the auspices of the newly established university of hawaiʻi press . the first five volumes finally appeared—to considerable local and international acclaim—in <year> , the same year that their author received a fulbright fellowship to work at the british natural history museum on its large holdings of hawaiian insects , many of them collected by r. c. l. perkins over a period of <integer> years beginning in the 1890s , at a time when many native fauna were disappearing.zimmerman spent most of the next two decades living on grant money and private funds , in london as an honorary associate of the british museum and in peterborough , new hampshire , where he had easy access to the museum of comparative zoology at harvard university . he completed a ph.d. from the university of london in <year> , published three more volumes of insects of hawaii in 1957–58 , and prepared one more that languished in the pipeline until <year> . he was also made a life-fellow of the american association for the advancement of science in <year> . meanwhile , back in honolulu , d. elmo hardy and others began publishing further volumes of insects of hawaii devoted to the exceptionally rich variety of diptera ( true flies ) in the islands , a variety zimmerman had called attention to in a short contribution to evolution in <year> with the provocative title , `` <integer> insect species of drosophila in hawaii ? —a challenge to geneticists and evolutionists '' ( evolution <integer> , pp . 557–558 ) .this paper helped stimulate one of the most outstanding and scientifically rewarding long-term , multidisciplinary research efforts in the history of evolutionary biology , encompassing systematics , genetics , ecology , and ethology of the drosophila complex . by the 1970s , however , zimmerman had trouble securing the funds needed to keep working on insects of hawaii and ended up accepting a generous offer from douglas waterhouse at australia 's csiro to turn his attention to producing another ambitious multivolume monograph , this time on australian weevils . by <year> , he had the first five volumes ready to publish , only to find that funding for this project , too , had dried up . he and his wife sold much of their estate , not just to subsidize publication , but also to endow an ongoing position at csiro for research on pacific weevils . in <year> , they moved from their cattle ranch near canberra to a home and laboratory on tura beach , where zimmerman spent his remaining years.among the awards zimmerman received for his life 's work were a fellowship to the entomological society of america in <year> ; v a d.sc . from the university of london in <year> ; the karl jordan medal for his work on hawaiian lepidoptera in <year> ; the herbert e. gregory medal at the pacific science congress in beijing in <year> ; and member of the order of australia and the university of hawaiʻi regents ' medal of distinction in <year> . == insects of hawaii == the insects of hawaii series , now under the editorship of james k. liebherr of cornell university , aims to provide a collaborative , comprehensive , taxonomy of all known hawaiian insect fauna . so far , more than 5,000 native arthropod species have been described . only vols . <integer> , <integer> , and <integer> are still in print , but the out-of-print volumes are being scanned and added to the university of hawaii 's digital repository , scholarspace . <integer> . reissue of the introduction . elwood c. zimmerman , with new foreword by james k. liebherr and short biography of the author by james o. juvik .

the <year> publication of that work helped inspire the technological development of the norplant implantable contraceptive at the population council . : <integer> the navy research was focused on developing artificial blood ; in the course of testing potential products to see if they could keep alive thymus glands taken from rabbits , he noticed that tumors in the gland could n't grow , as they did if the glands were perfused with blood . his curiosity as to why led to his work on angiogenesis.after his two years work for the navy , folkman completed his residency at massachusetts general hospital . he worked as an assistant surgeon at boston city hospital , then trained further in pediatric surgery at children 's hospital of philadelphia under c. everett koop . in <year> he was appointed surgeon-in-chief of children 's hospital boston at the age of <integer> . folkman was appointed the julia dyckman andrus professor of pediatric surgery at harvard medical school in <year> , where he was also professor of cell biology . he was the youngest full professor at harvard medical school in history . in addition to directing the children 's hospital boston surgical research laboratories , which grew to become the vascular biology program , for nearly four decades , he was the scientific director of the hospital 's vascular anomalies center . == work on angiogenesis == in <year> , he reported in the new england journal of medicine that solid tumors are angiogenesis-dependent . he hypothesized that there was an unknown `` factor '' that tumors secreted to help it increase its blood supply , and that if that factor could be blocked , tumors would wither and die . though his hypothesis was initially disregarded and treated with skepticism by most experts in the field , folkman persisted with his research . he and collaborators , who included bert l. vallee , soon identified the already-known fibroblast growth factor as an angiogenic factor , but the team 's work showed that there were additional , unknown factors . to help accelerate the work , folkman started collaborating with industry . in <year> harvard university and monsanto signed a ten-year industrial-funded research grant to support his cancer research , which at that time was the largest such arrangement ever made ; medical inventions arising from that research were the first for which harvard allowed its faculty to submit a patent application . robert langer worked as a postdoc in folkman 's lab during this time , concentrating on using silastic and other materials to deliver drugs.in the mid to late 1980s , two other angiogenic factors were identified by other labs that had been inspired by his work : angiogenin and vegf . with the factors identified , drug discovery could begin . when the monsanto agreement ( which yielded no products for monsanto ) ended , folkman started receiving research funding from takeda and then from a startup company , entremed , that put half its venture capital funding into research in the folkman lab.donald e. ingber soon discovered that a fungus , aspergillus fumigatus , secreted a chemical , fumagillin , that inhibited angiogenesis . takeda performed medicinal chemistry to optimize it , leading to development of <other> . folkman 's team later tested it in adults with hemangiomas ; they also used interferon alpha , an already approved drug that they had already shown to be an angiogenesis inhibitor , to treat infants with hemangiomas in some of the first clinical trials of angiogenesis inhibitors which were published in <year> . in these trials they also studied the levels of fibroblast growth factor in the urine of the trial subjects and published that work in <year> ; these were some of the first explorations of the use of biomarkers in clinical trials as surrogate endpoints.in <year> michael o '' reilly , working in the folkman lab with entremed funding , discovered the first endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor , angiostatin and then another , endostatin . entremed began developing them and soon struck a collaboration with bristol-myers , which caught national interest and spurred further investment in angiogenesis inhibitors by other pharma companies.in <year> he surprised the scientific world by hypothesizing that angiogenesis is as important in blood cancers as it is in solid tumors , and the next year he published work showing that a biomarker of angiogenesis was higher in all people with cancer , but especially high in people with blood cancers , and other evidence of the role of angiogenesis in blood cancers emerged as well . meanwhile , a member of his lab , robert d'amato , was looking for angiogenesis inhibitors , and discovered that thalidomide inhibited angiogenesis in <year> . around that time , the wife of a man who was dying of multiple myeloma and whom standard treatments had failed , called folkman asking him about his anti-angiogenesis ideas . folkman convinced the patient 's doctor to try thalidomide , and that doctor ended up conducting a clinical trial of thalidomide for people with multiple myeloma in which about a third of the subjects responded to the treatment . the results of that trial were published in the new england journal of medicine in 1999.in <year> , the first angiogenesis inhibitor , bevacizumab ( avastin ) , was approved by the fda , as a treatment for colon cancer . it is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that was discovered and developed by napoleone ferrara , a scientist at genentech . a similar drug , lucentis , was later approved for treating macular degeneration . after further work was done by celgene and others , in <year> the u.s. food and drug administration granted accelerated approval for thalidomide in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients . == awards == folkman was a member of the national academy of sciences , the institute of medicine , the american academy of arts and sciences , and the american philosophical society , among others . he was the author of some <integer> papers and more than <integer> book chapters and monographs and received scores of united states awards and honors for his research as well as numerous international awards , including the george ledlie prize from harvard , canada 's gairdner foundation international award , israel 's wolf prize , germany 's ernst schering prize , the united kingdom society for endocrinology 's dale medal in <year> , prince of asturias award , the golden plate award of the american academy of achievement and switzerland 's dr. josef steiner cancer research award . in <year> he was awarded the scientific grand prize of the lefoulon-delalande foundation . in <year> , folkman was one of seven people appointed by president bush to the national cancer advisory board of the national institutes of health . for his discoveries which originated the concept and developed the field of angiogenesis research , folkman was awarded the wolf prize in medicine in <year> . he was awarded the massry prize from the keck school of medicine , university of southern california in <year> . on may <days> , <year> folkman received an honorary doctorate from the faculty of medicine at uppsala university , sweden == death == folkman died of a heart attack in denver on january <days> , <year> at the age of <integer> en route to deliver the <year> keynote address at the keystone symposium ( molecular mechanisms of angiogenesis in development and disease ) in vancouver , british columbia.he was survived by his wife , paula , whom he met and married while doing his surgical residency , two daughters , and a granddaughter . == references == == further reading == cooke , robert ;

july <days> , <year> – november <days> , <year> ) was an american economist and statistician who received the <year> nobel memorial prize in economic sciences for his research on consumption analysis , monetary history and theory and the complexity of stabilization policy . with george stigler and others , friedman was among the intellectual leaders of the chicago school of economics , a neoclassical school of economic thought associated with the work of the faculty at the university of chicago that rejected keynesianism in favor of monetarism until the <other> , when it turned to new classical macroeconomics heavily based on the concept of rational expectations . several students , young professors and academics who were recruited or mentored by friedman at chicago went on to become leading economists , including gary becker , robert fogel , thomas sowell and robert lucas jr.friedman 's challenges to what he later called `` naive keynesian theory '' began with his interpretation of consumption , which tracks how consumers spend . he introduced a theory which would later become part of the mainstream and among the first to propagate the theory of consumption smoothing . during the 1960s he became the main advocate opposing keynesian government policies , and described his approach ( along with mainstream economics ) as using `` keynesian language and apparatus '' yet rejecting its initial conclusions . he theorized that there existed a natural rate of unemployment and argued that unemployment below this rate would cause inflation to accelerate . he argued that the phillips curve was in the long run vertical at the `` natural rate '' and predicted what would come to be known as stagflation . friedman promoted a macroeconomic viewpoint known as monetarism and argued that a steady , small expansion of the money supply was the preferred policy , as compared to rapid , and unexpected changes . his ideas concerning monetary policy , taxation , privatization and deregulation influenced government policies , especially during the 1980s . his monetary theory influenced the federal reserve 's monetary policy in response to the global financial crisis of 2007–2008.after retiring from the university of chicago in <year> , and becoming emeritus professor in economics in <year> , friedman was an advisor to republican president ronald reagan and conservative british prime minister margaret thatcher . his political philosophy extolled the virtues of a free market economic system with minimal government intervention in social matters . he once stated that his role in eliminating conscription in the united states was his proudest achievement . in his <year> book capitalism and freedom , friedman advocated policies such as a volunteer military , freely floating exchange rates , abolition of medical licenses , a negative income tax and school vouchers and opposition to the war on drugs and support for drug liberalization policies . his support for school choice led him to found the friedman foundation for educational choice , later renamed edchoice.friedman 's works cover a broad range of economic topics and public policy issues . his books and essays have had global influence , including in former communist states . a <year> survey of economists commissioned by the ejw ranked friedman as the second-most popular economist of the 20th century , following only john maynard keynes . upon his death , the economist described him as `` the most influential economist of the second half of the 20th century ... possibly of all of it '' . == early life == friedman was born in brooklyn , new york on july <days> , <year> . his parents , sára ethel ( née landau ) and jenő saul friedman , were jewish working-class immigrants from beregszász in carpathian ruthenia , kingdom of hungary ( now berehove in ukraine ) . they emigrated to america in their early teens . they both worked as dry goods merchants . friedman was their fourth child and only son . shortly after his birth , the family relocated to rahway , new jersey.friedman 's family experienced financial troubles , and financial uncertainty caused stability of income to be low . friedman described his family 's situation in the following manner : the family income was small and highly uncertain ; financial crisis was a constant companion . yet there was always enough to eat , and the family atmosphere was warm and supportive.friedman 's father , jenő saul friedman , died during friedman 's senior year of high school , leaving friedman and two older sisters to care for his mother , sára ethel friedman.in his early teens , friedman was injured in a car accident , which scarred his upper lip . a talented student and an avid reader , friedman graduated from rahway high school in <year> , just before his 16th birthday . although no family members had gone to university before milton , friedman was awarded a competitive scholarship to rutgers university ( then a private university receiving limited support from the state of new jersey , e.g. , for such scholarships ) . friedman was expected to finance the cost of university himself . he graduated from rutgers in 1932.friedman initially intended to become an actuary or mathematician , however the state of the economy , which was at this point in a deep depression , convinced him to become an economist . he was offered two scholarships to do graduate work , one in mathematics at brown university and the other in economics at the university of chicago , where he would later teach . friedman chose the latter , earning a master of arts degree in <year> . he was strongly influenced by jacob viner , frank knight , and henry simons . friedman met his future wife , economist rose director , while at the university of chicago.during the 1933–1934 academic year , he had a fellowship at columbia university , where he studied statistics with statistician and economist harold hotelling . he was back in chicago for the 1934–1935 academic year , working as a research assistant for henry schultz , who was then working on theory and measurement of demand.during the aforementioned <other> academic year , friedman formed what would later prove to be lifetime friendships with george stigler and w. allen wallis , both of whom taught with friedman at the university of chicago . == public service == friedman was unable to find academic employment , so in <year> he followed his friend w. allen wallis to washington , d.c. , where franklin d. roosevelt 's new deal was `` a lifesaver '' for many young economists . at this stage , friedman said he and his wife `` regarded the job-creation programs such as the wpa , ccc , and pwa appropriate responses to the critical situation , '' but not `` the price- and wage-fixing measures of the national recovery administration and the agricultural adjustment administration . '' foreshadowing his later ideas , he believed price controls interfered with an essential signaling mechanism to help resources be used where they were most valued . indeed , friedman later concluded that all government intervention associated with the new deal was `` the wrong cure for the wrong disease , '' arguing the federal reserve was to blame , and that they should have expanded the money supply in reaction to what he later described in a monetary history of the united states as `` the great contraction . '' later , friedman and his colleague anna schwartz wrote a monetary history of the united states , 1867–1960 , which argued that the great depression was caused by a severe monetary contraction due to banking crises and poor policy on the part of the federal reserve . robert j. shiller describes the book as the `` most influential account '' of the great depression . during <year> , he began working for the national resources planning board , which was then working on a large consumer budget survey . ideas from this project later became a part of his theory of the consumption function , a book which first described consumption smoothing and the permanent income hypothesis . friedman began employment with the national bureau of economic research during the autumn of <year> to assist simon kuznets in his work on professional income . this work resulted in their jointly authored publication incomes from independent professional practice , which introduced the concepts of permanent and transitory income , a major component of the permanent income hypothesis that friedman worked out in greater detail in the 1950s . the book hypothesizes that professional licensing artificially restricts the supply of services and raises prices.incomes from independent professional practice remained quite controversial within the economics community because of friedman 's hypothesis that barriers to entry , which were exercised and enforced by the american medical association , led to higher than average wages for physicians , compared to other professional groups . barriers to entry are a fixed cost which must be incurred regardless of any outside factors such as work experience , or other factors of human capital.during <year> , friedman was appointed as an assistant professor teaching economics at the university of wisconsin–madison , but encountered anti semitism in the economics department and returned to government service . from <year> to <year> friedman worked on wartime tax policy for the federal government , as an advisor to senior officials of the united states department of the treasury . as a treasury spokesman during <year> , he advocated a keynesian policy of taxation . he helped to invent the payroll withholding tax system , since the federal government needed money to fund the war . he later said , `` i have no apologies for it , but i really wish we had n't found it necessary and i wish there were some way of abolishing withholding now . '' in milton and rose friedman 's jointly-written memoir , he wrote , `` rose has repeatedly chided me over the years about the role that i played in making possible the current overgrown government we both criticize so strongly . '' == academic career == === early years === in <year> , friedman accepted a position at the university of wisconsin–madison , but left because of differences with faculty regarding united states involvement in world war ii . friedman believed the united states should enter the war . in <year> , friedman joined the division of war research at columbia university ( headed by w. allen wallis and harold hotelling ) , where he spent the rest of world war ii working as a mathematical statistician , focusing on problems of weapons design , military tactics , and metallurgical experiments.in <year> , friedman submitted incomes from independent professional practice ( co-authored with kuznets and completed during <year> ) to columbia as his doctoral dissertation . the university awarded him a phd in <year> . friedman spent the 1945–1946 academic year teaching at the university of minnesota ( where his friend george stigler was employed ) . on february <days> , <year> , his only son , david d. friedman , who would later follow in his father 's footsteps as an economist was born . === university of chicago === in <year> , friedman accepted an offer to teach economic theory at the university of chicago ( a position opened by departure of his former professor jacob viner to princeton university ) . friedman would work for the university of chicago for the next <integer> years . there he contributed to the establishment of an intellectual community that produced a number of nobel memorial prize winners , known collectively as the chicago school of economics.at the time , arthur f. burns , who was then the head of the national bureau of economic research , and later chairman of the federal reserve , asked friedman to rejoin the bureau 's staff . he accepted the invitation , and assumed responsibility for the bureau 's inquiry into the role of money in the business cycle . as a result , he initiated the `` workshop in money and banking '' ( the `` chicago workshop '' ) , which promoted a revival of monetary studies . during the latter half of the 1940s , friedman began a collaboration with anna schwartz , an economic historian at the bureau , that would ultimately result in the <year> publication of a book co-authored by friedman and schwartz , a monetary history of the united states , 1867–1960.friedman spent the 1954–1955 academic year as a fulbright visiting fellow at gonville and caius college , cambridge . at the time , the cambridge economics faculty was divided into a keynesian majority ( including joan robinson and richard kahn ) and an anti-keynesian minority ( headed by dennis robertson ) . friedman speculated he was invited to the fellowship because his views were unacceptable to both of the cambridge factions . later his weekly columns for newsweek magazine ( 1966–84 ) were well read and increasingly influential among political and business people , and helped earn the magazine a gerald loeb special award in <year> . from <year> to <year> , he and paul samuelson participated in the economics cassette series , a biweekly subscription series where the economist would discuss the days ' issues for about a half-hour at a time . ==== a theory of the consumption function ==== one of milton friedman 's most popular works , a theory of the consumption function , challenged traditional keynesian viewpoints about the household . this work was originally published in <year> by princeton university press , and it reanalyzed the relationship displayed `` between aggregate consumption or aggregate savings and aggregate income . '' friedman 's counterpart keynes believed people would modify their household consumption expenditures to relate to their existing income levels . friedman 's research introduced the term `` permanent income '' to the world , which was the average of a household 's expected income over several years , and he also developed the permanent income hypothesis . friedman thought income consisted of several components , namely transitory and permanent . he established the formula y = y p + y t { \displaystyle y=y_ { p } +y_ { t } } in order to calculate income , with p representing the permanent component , and t representing the transitory component.milton friedman 's research changed how economists interpreted the consumption function , and his work pushed the idea that current income was not the only factor affecting people 's adjustment household consumption expenditures . instead , expected income levels also affected how households would change their consumption expenditures . friedman 's contributions strongly influenced research on consumer behavior , and he further defined how to predict consumption smoothing , which contradicts keynes ' marginal propensity to consume . although this work presented many controversial points of view which differed from existing viewpoints established by keynes , a theory of the consumption function helped friedman gain respect in the field of economics . his work on the permanent income hypothesis is among the many contributions which were listed as reasons for his sveriges-riskbank prize in economic sciences . his work was later expanded on by christopher d. carroll , especially in regards to the absence of liquidity constraints.the permanent income hypothesis faces some criticism , mainly from keynesian economists . the primary criticism of the hypothesis is based on a lack of liquidity constraints . ==== capitalism and freedom ==== his book capitalism and freedom , inspired by a series of lectures he gave at wabash college , brought him national and international attention outside academia . it was published in <year> by the university of chicago press and consists of essays that used non-mathematical economic models to explore issues of public policy . it sold over 400,000 copies in the first eighteen years and more than half a million since <year> . capitalism and freedom was translated into eighteen languages . friedman talks about the need to move to a classically liberal society , that free markets would help nations and individuals in the long-run and fix the efficiency problems currently faced by the united states and other major countries of the 1950s and 1960s . he goes through the chapters specifying an issue in each respective chapter from the role of government and money supply to social welfare programs to a special chapter on occupational licensure . friedman concludes capitalism and freedom with his `` classical liberal [ sic ] '' stance that government should stay out of matters that do not need and should only involve itself when absolutely necessary for the survival of its people and the country . he recounts how the best of a country 's abilities come from its free markets while its failures come from government intervention . == post-retirement == in <year> , at the age of <integer> , friedman retired from the university of chicago after teaching there for <integer> years . he and his wife moved to san francisco , where he became a visiting scholar at the federal reserve bank of san francisco . from <year> on , he was affiliated with the hoover institution at stanford university . during <year> , friedman was approached by bob chitester and the free to choose network . they asked him to create a television program presenting his economic and social philosophy.friedman and his wife rose worked on this project for the next three years , and during <year> , the ten-part series , titled free to choose , was broadcast by the public broadcasting service ( pbs ) . the companion book to the series ( co-authored by milton and his wife , rose friedman ) , also titled free to choose , was the bestselling nonfiction book of 1980.friedman served as an unofficial adviser to ronald reagan during his <year> presidential campaign , and then served on the president 's economic policy advisory board for the rest of the reagan administration . ebenstein says friedman was `` the 'guru ' of the reagan administration . '' in <year> he received the national medal of science and reagan honored him with the presidential medal of freedom.friedman is known now as one of the most influential economists of the 20th century . throughout the 1980s and 1990s , friedman continued to write editorials and appear on television . he made several visits to eastern europe and to china , where he also advised governments . he was also for many years a trustee of the philadelphia society . == personal life == friedman had two children , david and jan . he first met his wife , rose friedman ( née director ) , at the university of chicago in <year> , and later wed six years later , in 1938.friedman was noticeably shorter than some of his colleagues ; he measured 1.52 meters ( 5.0 ft ) , and has been described as an `` elfin libertarian '' by binyamin appelbaum.rose friedman , when asked about friedman 's successes , said that “ i have never had the desire to compete with milton professionally ( perhaps because i was smart enough to recognize i could n't ) . on the other hand , he has always made me feel that his achievement is my achievement . `` during the 1960s , friedman built , and subsequently maintained a cottage in fairlee , vermont . friedman also had an apartment in russian hill , san francisco , where he lived from <year> until his death . === religious views === according to a <year> article in commentary magazine , his `` parents were moderately observant jews , but friedman , after an intense burst of childhood piety , rejected religion altogether . '' he described himself as an agnostic . friedman wrote extensively of his life and experiences , especially in <year> in his memoirs with his wife , rose , titled two lucky people . in this book , rose friedman describes how she and milton friedman raised their two children , janet and david , with a christmas tree in the home . `` orthodox jews of course , do not celebrate christmas . however , just as , when i was a child , my mother had permitted me to have a christmas tree one year when my friend had one , she not only tolerated our having a christmas tree , she even strung popcorn to hang on it . '' === death === friedman died of heart failure at the age of <integer> years in san francisco on november <days> , <year> . he was still a working economist performing original economic research ; his last column was published in the wall street journal the day after his death . he was survived by his wife , rose friedman ( who would die on august <days> , <year> ) and their two children , david d. friedman , known for the machinery of freedom , as well as his unique anarcho-capitalism from a chicago school perspective , and attorney and bridge player jan martel . == scholarly contributions == === economics === friedman was best known for reviving interest in the money supply as a determinant of the nominal value of output , that is , the quantity theory of money . monetarism is the set of views associated with modern quantity theory . its origins can be traced back to the <other> school of salamanca or even further ; however , friedman 's contribution is largely responsible for its modern popularization . he co-authored , with anna schwartz , a monetary history of the united states , 1867–1960 ( <year> ) , which was an examination of the role of the money supply and economic activity in the u.s. history.friedman was the main proponent of the monetarist school of economics . he maintained that there is a close and stable association between inflation and the money supply , mainly that inflation could be avoided with proper regulation of the monetary base 's growth rate . he famously used the analogy of `` dropping money out of a helicopter '' , in order to avoid dealing with money injection mechanisms and other factors that would overcomplicate his models.friedman 's arguments were designed to counter the popular concept of cost-push inflation , that the increased general price level at the time was the result of increases in the price of oil , or increases in wages ; as he wrote : inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon . friedman rejected the use of fiscal policy as a tool of demand management ; and he held that the government 's role in the guidance of the economy should be restricted severely . friedman wrote extensively on the great depression , and he termed the 1929–1933 period the great contraction . he argued that the depression had been caused by an ordinary financial shock whose duration and seriousness were greatly increased by the subsequent contraction of the money supply caused by the misguided policies of the directors of the federal reserve . the fed was largely responsible for converting what might have been a garden-variety recession , although perhaps a fairly severe one , into a major catastrophe . instead of using its powers to offset the depression , it presided over a decline in the quantity of money by one-third from <year> to <year> ... far from the depression being a failure of the free-enterprise system , it was a tragic failure of government . this theory was put forth in a monetary history of the united states , and the chapter on the great depression was then published as a stand-alone book entitled the great contraction , 1929–1933 . both books are still in print from the princeton university press , and some editions include as an appendix a speech at a university of chicago event honoring friedman in which ben bernanke made this statement : let me end my talk by abusing slightly my status as an official representative of the federal reserve . i would like to say to milton and anna : regarding the great depression , you 're right . we did it . we 're very sorry . but thanks to you , we wo n't do it again . friedman also argued for the removal of government intervention in currency markets , thereby spawning an enormous literature on the subject , as well as promoting the practice of freely floating exchange rates . his close friend george stigler explained , `` as is customary in science , he did not win a full victory , in part because research was directed along different lines by the theory of rational expectations , a newer approach developed by robert lucas , also at the university of chicago . '' the relationship between friedman and lucas , or new classical macroeconomics as a whole , was highly complex . the friedmanian phillips curve was an interesting starting point for lucas , but he soon realized that the solution provided by friedman was not quite satisfactory . lucas elaborated a new approach in which rational expectations were presumed instead of the friedmanian adaptive expectations . due to this reformulation , the story in which the theory of the new classical phillips curve was embedded radically changed . this modification , however , had a significant effect on friedman 's own approach , so , as a result , the theory of the friedmanian phillips curve also changed . moreover , new classical adherent neil wallace , who was a graduate student at the university of chicago between <year> and <year> , regarded friedman 's theoretical courses as a mess , highlighting the strained relationship between monetarism and new classical schools.friedman was also known for his work on the consumption function , the permanent income hypothesis ( <year> ) , which friedman himself referred to as his best scientific work . this work contended that utility-maximizing consumers would spend a proportional amount of what they perceived to be their permanent income . permanent income refers to such factors like human capital . windfall gains would mostly be saved because of the law of diminishing marginal utility.friedman 's essay `` the methodology of positive economics '' ( <year> ) provided the epistemological pattern for his own subsequent research and to a degree that of the chicago school . there he argued that economics as science should be free of value judgments for it to be objective . moreover , a useful economic theory should be judged not by its descriptive realism but by its simplicity and fruitfulness as an engine of prediction . that is , students should measure the accuracy of its predictions , rather than the 'soundness of its assumptions ' . his argument was part of an ongoing debate among such statisticians as jerzy neyman , leonard savage , and ronald fisher.however , despite being an advocate of the free market , milton friedman believed that the government had two crucial roles . in an interview with phil donahue , milton friedman argued that `` the two basic functions of a government are to protect the nation against foreign enemy , and to protect citizens against its fellows. ” he also admitted that although privatization of national defense could reduce the overall cost , he has not yet thought of a way to make this privatization possible . === rejection and subsequent evolution of the philips curve === other important contributions include his critique of the phillips curve and the concept of the natural rate of unemployment ( <year> ) . this critique associated his name , together with that of edmund phelps , with the insight that a government that brings about greater inflation can not permanently reduce unemployment by doing so . unemployment may <days> temporarily lower , if the inflation is a surprise , but in the long run unemployment will be determined by the frictions and imperfections of the labor market . if the conditions are not met and inflation is expected , the `` long run '' effects will replace the `` short term '' effects.through his critique , the philips curve evolved from a strict model emphasizing the connection between inflation and unemployment as being absolute , to a model which emphasized short term unemployment reductions and long term employment stagnations.friedman 's revised and updated phillips curve also changed as a result of robert lucas 's idea of rational expectations , replacing the adaptive expectations friedman used . === statistics === one of his most famous contributions to statistics is sequential sampling . friedman did statistical work at the division of war research at columbia , where he and his colleagues came up with the technique . it became , in the words of the new palgrave dictionary of economics , `` the standard analysis of quality control inspection '' . the dictionary adds , `` like many of friedman 's contributions , in retrospect it seems remarkably simple and obvious to apply basic economic ideas to quality control ; that , however , is a measure of his genius . '' == public policy positions == === federal reserve and monetary policy === although friedman concluded the government does have a role in the monetary system he was critical of the federal reserve due to its poor performance and felt it should be abolished . he was opposed to federal reserve policies , even during the so-called 'volcker shock ' that was labeled 'monetarist ' . friedman believed the federal reserve system should ultimately be replaced with a computer program . he favored a system that would automatically buy and sell securities in response to changes in the money supply.the proposal to constantly grow the money supply at a certain predetermined amount every year has become known as friedman 's k-percent rule . there is debate about the effectiveness of a theoretical money supply targeting regime . the fed 's inability to meet its money supply targets from 1978–1982 led some to conclude it is not a feasible alternative to more conventional inflation and interest rate targeting . towards the end of his life , friedman expressed doubt about the validity of targeting the quantity of money . to date , most countries have adopted inflation targeting instead of the k-percent rule.idealistically , friedman actually favored the principles of the 1930s chicago plan , which would have ended fractional reserve banking and , thus , private money creation . it would force banks to have <integer> % reserves backing deposits , and instead place money creation powers solely in the hands of the us government . this would make targeting money growth more possible , as endogenous money created by fractional reserve lending would no longer be a major issue.friedman was a strong advocate for floating exchange rates throughout the entire bretton-woods period ( <other> ) . he argued that a flexible exchange rate would make external adjustment possible and allow countries to avoid balance of payments crises . he saw fixed exchange rates as an undesirable form of government intervention . the case was articulated in an influential <year> paper , `` the case for flexible exchange rates , '' at a time when most commentators regarded the possibility of floating exchange rates as an unrealistic policy proposal . === foreign policy === while walter oi is credited with establishing the economic basis for a volunteer military , friedman was a proponent , and was credited with ending the draft , stating that the draft was `` inconsistent with a free society . `` in capitalism and freedom , he argued conscription is inequitable and arbitrary , preventing young men from shaping their lives as they see fit . during the nixon administration he headed the committee to research a conversion to paid/volunteer armed force . he would later state his role in eliminating the conscription in the united states was his proudest accomplishment . friedman did , however , believe the introduction of a system of universal military training as a reserve in cases of war-time could be justified . he still opposed its implementation in the united states , describing it as a “ monstrosity ” .biographer lanny ebenstein noted a drift over time in friedman 's views from an interventionist to a more cautious foreign policy . he supported us involvement in the second world war and initially supported a hard-line against communism , but moderated over time . however , friedman did state in a <year> interview that he was an anti-interventionist . he opposed the gulf war and the iraq war . in a spring <year> interview , friedman said the us 's stature in the world had been eroded by the iraq war , but that it might be improved if iraq were to become a peaceful and independent country . === libertarianism and the republican party === friedman was an economic advisor and speech writer in barry goldwater 's failed presidential campaign in <year> . he was an advisor to california governor ronald reagan , and was active in reagan 's presidential campaigns . he served as a member of president reagan 's economic policy advisory board starting in <year> . in <year> , he received the presidential medal of freedom and the national medal of science.friedman stated that he was a libertarian philosophically , but a member of the u.s. republican party for the sake of `` expediency '' ( `` i am a libertarian with a small ' l ' and a republican with a capital ' r . ' and i am a republican with a capital ' r ' on grounds of expediency , not on principle . '' ) but , he said , `` i think the term classical liberal is also equally applicable . i do n't really care very much what i 'm called . i 'm much more interested in having people thinking about the ideas , rather than the person . `` his citation for the presidential medal of freedom reads : `` he has used a brilliant mind to advance a moral vision : the vision of a society where men and women are free , free to choose , but where government is not as free to override their decisions . that vision has changed america , and it is changing the world . all of us owe a tremendous debt to this man ’ s towering intellect and his devotion to liberty . '' === governmental involvement in the economy === friedman was supportive of the state provision of some public goods that private businesses are not considered as being able to provide . however , he argued that many of the services performed by government could be performed better by the private sector . above all , if some public goods are provided by the state , he believed that they should not be a legal monopoly where private competition is prohibited ; for example , he wrote : there is no way to justify our present public monopoly of the post office . it may <days> argued that the carrying of mail is a technical monopoly and that a government monopoly is the least of evils . along these lines , one could perhaps justify a government post office , but not the present law , which makes it illegal for anybody else to carry the mail . if the delivery of mail is a technical monopoly , no one else will be able to succeed in competition with the government . if it is not , there is no reason why the government should be engaged in it . the only way to find out is to leave other people free to enter.in <year> , friedman criticized social security in his book capitalism and freedom , arguing that it had created welfare dependency . however , in the penultimate chapter of the same book , friedman argued that while capitalism had greatly reduced the extent of poverty in absolute terms , `` poverty is in part a relative matter , [ and ] even in [ wealthy western ] countries , there are clearly many people living under conditions that the rest of us label as poverty . '' friedman also noted that while private charity could be one recourse for alleviating poverty and cited late 19th century britain and the united states as exemplary periods of extensive private charity and eleemosynary activity , he made the following point : it can be argued that private charity is insufficient because the benefits from it accrue to people other than those who make the gifts— ... a neighborhood effect . i am distressed by the sight of poverty ; i am benefited by its alleviation ; but i am benefited equally whether i or someone else pays for its alleviation ; the benefits of other people 's charity therefore partly accrue to me . to put it differently , we might all of us be willing to contribute to the relief of poverty , provided everyone else did . we might not be willing to contribute the same amount without such assurance . in small communities , public pressure can suffice to realize the proviso even with private charity . in the large impersonal communities that are increasingly coming to dominate our society , it is much more difficult for it to do so . suppose one accepts , as i do , this line of reasoning as justifying governmental action to alleviate poverty ; to set , as it were , a floor under the standard of life of every person in the community . [ while there are questions of how much should be spent and how , the ] arrangement that recommends itself on purely mechanical grounds is a negative income tax . ... the advantages of this arrangement are clear . it is directed specifically at the problem of poverty . it gives help in the form most useful to the individual , namely , cash . it is general and could be substituted for the host of special measures now in effect . it makes explicit the cost borne by society . it operates outside the market . like any other measures to alleviate poverty , it reduces the incentives of those helped to help themselves , but it does not eliminate that incentive entirely , as a system of supplementing incomes up to some fixed minimum would . an extra dollar earned always means more money available for expenditure . friedman argued further that other advantages of the negative income tax were that it could fit directly into the tax system , would be less costly , and would reduce the administrative burden of implementing a social safety net . friedman reiterated these arguments <integer> years later in free to choose , with the additional proviso that such a reform would only be satisfactory if it replaced the current system of welfare programs rather than augment it . according to economist robert h. frank , writing in the new york times , friedman 's views in this regard were grounded in a belief that while `` market forces ... accomplish wonderful things '' , they `` can not ensure a distribution of income that enables all citizens to meet basic economic needs '' .in <year> , friedman expressed support for ecotaxes in general in an interview on the phil donahue show , saying `` the best way to [ deal with pollution ] is to impose a tax on the cost of the pollutants emitted by a car and make an incentive for car manufacturers and for consumers to keep down the amount of pollution . '' in free to choose , friedman reiterated his support for ecotaxes as compared with increased environmental regulation , stating `` the preservation of the environment and the avoidance of undue pollution are real problems and they are problems concerning which the government has an important role to play . … most economists agree that a far better way to control pollution than the present method of specific regulation and supervision is to introduce market discipline by imposing effluent charges . `` in his <year> article `` the role of government in education '' friedman proposed supplementing publicly operated schools with privately run but publicly funded schools through a system of school vouchers . reforms similar to those proposed in the article were implemented in , for example , chile in <year> and sweden in <year> . in <year> , friedman , together with his wife , founded the friedman foundation for educational choice to advocate school choice and vouchers . in <year> , the friedman foundation changed its name to edchoice to honor the friedmans ' desire to have the educational choice movement live on without their names attached to it after their deaths.michael walker of the fraser institute and friedman hosted a series of conferences from <year> to <year> . the goal was to create a clear definition of economic freedom and a method for measuring it . eventually this resulted in the first report on worldwide economic freedom , economic freedom in the world . this annual report has since provided data for numerous peer-reviewed studies and has influenced policy in several nations.with sixteen other distinguished economists he opposed the copyright term extension act , and signed on to an amicus brief filed in eldred v. ashcroft . friedman jokingly described it as a `` no-brainer '' .friedman argued for stronger basic legal ( constitutional ) protection of economic rights and freedoms to further promote industrial-commercial growth and prosperity and buttress democracy and freedom and the rule of law generally in society . === social issues === friedman also supported libertarian policies such as legalization of drugs and prostitution . during <year> , friedman and more than <integer> other economists advocated discussions regarding the economic benefits of the legalization of marijuana.friedman was also a supporter of gay rights . he never specifically supported same-sex marriage , instead saying `` i do not believe there should be any discrimination against gays . `` friedman favored immigration , saying `` legal and illegal immigration has a very positive impact on the u.s . economy . '' however , he suggested that immigrants ought not to have access to the welfare system . friedman stated that immigration from mexico had been a `` good thing '' , in particular illegal immigration . friedman argued that illegal immigration was a boon because they `` take jobs that most residents of this country are unwilling to take , they provide employers with workers of a kind they can not get '' and they do not use welfare . in free to choose , friedman wrote : no arbitrary obstacles should prevent people from achieving those positions for which their talents fit them and which their values lead them to seek . not birth , nationality , color , religion , sex , nor any other irrelevant characteristic should determine the opportunities that are open to a person — only his abilities.friedman also famously argued that the welfare state must end before immigration , or more specifically , before open borders , because immigrants might have an incentive to come directly because of welfare payments . economist bryan caplan has disputed this assertion , arguing that welfare is generally distributed not among immigrants , but instead retirees , through social security.friedman was against public housing as he believed it was also a form of welfare . he believed the one of the main arguments that politicians have for public housing is that regular low income housing was too expensive due to the imposed higher cost of a fire and police department . he believed that it would only increase taxes and not benefit low income people in the long run . friedman was an advocate for direct cash instead of public housing believing that the people would be better off that way . he argued that liberals would never agree with this idea due to them not trusting their own citizens . he also stated that regression has already happened with more land being left vacant due to slow construction . friedman argued that public housing instead encourages juvenile delinquency.friedman was also against minimum wage laws , he saw them as a clear case as one can find that the precise opposite is happening when this was attempted . minimum wage laws would increase unemployment in his eyes and that employers would not hire back workers that were already there for less pay . in his view , this would leave low income people worse off because the voters for minimum wage laws would then become the victims of unemployment . he believed that these ideas of new minimum wage laws came from northern factories and unions , in an attempt to reduce competition from the south . == honors , recognition and legacy == george h. nash , a leading historian of american conservatism , says that by `` the end of the 1960s he was probably the most highly regarded and influential conservative scholar in the country , and one of the few with an international reputation . '' in <year> , friedman received the golden plate award of the american academy of achievement . friedman allowed the libertarian cato institute to use his name for its biennial milton friedman prize for advancing liberty beginning in <year> . a friedman prize was given to the late british economist peter bauer in <year> , peruvian economist hernando de soto in <year> , mart laar , former estonian prime minister in <year> and a young venezuelan student yon goicoechea in <year> . his wife rose , sister of aaron director , with whom he initiated the friedman foundation for educational choice , served on the international selection committee.friedman was also a recipient of the nobel memorial prize in economics.upon friedman 's death , harvard president lawrence summers called him `` the great liberator '' , saying `` any honest democrat will admit that we are now all friedmanites . '' he said friedman 's great popular contribution was `` in convincing people of the importance of allowing free markets to operate . `` stephen moore , a member of the editorial forward of the wall street journal , said in <year> : `` quoting the most-revered champion of free-market economics since adam smith has become a little like quoting the bible . '' he adds , `` there are sometimes multiple and conflicting interpretations . `` although post-keynesian economist john kenneth galbraith was a prominent critic of friedman and his ideology , he conceded that `` the age of john maynard keynes gave way to the age of milton friedman . '' === <year> nobel memorial prize in economic sciences === friedman won the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences , the sole recipient for <year> , `` for his achievements in the fields of consumption analysis , monetary history and theory and for his demonstration of the complexity of stabilization policy . '' his appointment was controversial , mainly for his association with military dictator augusto pinochet . some economists , such as institutional economist and <year> nobel prize winner gunnar myrdal , criticized friedman , and myrdal 's own <year> nobel prize partner friedrich hayek , for being reactionaries . myrdal 's criticism caused some economists to oppose the sveriges riksbank prize in economics sciences in memory of alfred nobel itself . === hong kong === friedman once said : `` if you want to see capitalism in action , go to hong kong . '' he wrote in <year> that the hong kong economy was perhaps the best example of a free market economy.one month before his death , he wrote `` hong kong wrong—what would cowperthwaite say ? '' in the wall street journal , criticizing donald tsang , chief executive of hong kong , for abandoning `` positive non interventionism . '' tsang later said he was merely changing the slogan to `` big market , small government '' , where small government is defined as less than <integer> % of gdp . in a debate between tsang and his rival alan leong before the <year> hong kong chief executive election , leong introduced the topic and jokingly accused tsang of angering friedman to death ( friedman had died only a year prior ) . === chile === during <year> , two years after the military coup that brought military dictator president augusto pinochet to power and ended the government of salvador allende , the economy of chile experienced a severe crisis . friedman and arnold harberger accepted an invitation of a private chilean foundation to visit chile and speak on principles of economic freedom . he spent seven days in chile giving a series of lectures at the universidad católica de chile and the ( national ) university of chile . one of the lectures was entitled `` the fragility of freedom '' and according to friedman , `` dealt with precisely the threat to freedom from a centralized military government . `` in a letter to pinochet of april <days> , <year> , friedman considered the `` key economic problems of chile are clearly ... inflation and the promotion of a healthy social market economy '' . he stated that `` there is only one way to end inflation : by drastically reducing the rate of increase of the quantity of money '' and that `` cutting government spending is by far and away the most desirable way to reduce the fiscal deficit , because it ... strengthens the private sector thereby laying the foundations for healthy economic growth '' . as to how rapidly inflation should be ended , friedman felt that `` for chile where inflation is raging at 10–20 % a month ... gradualism is not feasible . it would involve so painful an operation over so long a period that the patient would not survive . '' choosing `` a brief period of higher unemployment '' was the lesser evil .. and that `` the experience of germany , ... of brazil ... , of the post-war adjustment in the u.s. ... all argue for shock treatment '' . in the letter friedman recommended to deliver the shock approach with `` a package to eliminate the surprise and to relieve acute distress '' and `` for definiteness let me sketch the contents of a package proposal ... to be taken as illustrative '' although his knowledge of chile was `` too limited to enable [ him ] to be precise or comprehensive '' . he listed a `` sample proposal '' of <integer> monetary and fiscal measures including `` the removal of as many as obstacles as possible that now hinder the private market . for example , suspend ... the present law against discharging employees '' . he closed , stating `` such a shock program could end inflation in months '' . his letter suggested that cutting spending to reduce the fiscal deficit would result in less transitional unemployment than raising taxes . sergio de castro , a chilean chicago school graduate , became the nation 's minister of finance in <year> . during his six-year tenure , foreign investment increased , restrictions were placed on striking and labor unions , and gdp rose yearly . a foreign exchange program was created between the catholic university of chile and the university of chicago . many other chicago school alumni were appointed government posts during and after pinochet 's dictatorship ; others taught its economic doctrine at chilean universities . they became known as the chicago boys.friedman defended his activity in chile on the grounds that , in his opinion , the adoption of free market policies not only improved the economic situation of chile but also contributed to the amelioration of pinochet 's rule and to the eventual transition to a democratic government during <year> . that idea is included in capitalism and freedom , in which he declared that economic freedom is not only desirable in itself but is also a necessary condition for political freedom . in his <year> documentary free to choose , he said the following : `` chile is not a politically free system , and i do not condone the system . but the people there are freer than the people in communist societies because government plays a smaller role . ... the conditions of the people in the past few years has been getting better and not worse . they would be still better to get rid of the junta and to be able to have a free democratic system . '' in <year> , friedman stated that he has `` never refrained from criticizing the political system in chile . '' in <year> he said : `` i have nothing good to say about the political regime that pinochet imposed . it was a terrible political regime . the real miracle of chile is not how well it has done economically ; the real miracle of chile is that a military junta was willing to go against its principles and support a free market regime designed by principled believers in a free market . ... in chile , the drive for political freedom , that was generated by economic freedom and the resulting economic success , ultimately resulted in a referendum that introduced political democracy . now , at long last , chile has all three things : political freedom , human freedom and economic freedom . chile will continue to be an interesting experiment to watch to see whether it can keep all three or whether , now that it has political freedom , that political freedom will tend to be used to destroy or reduce economic freedom . '' he stressed that the lectures he gave in chile were the same lectures he later gave in china and other socialist states . he further stated `` i do not consider it as evil for an economist to render technical economic advice to the chilean government , any more than i would regard it as evil for a physician to give technical medical advice to the chilean government to help end a medical plague . `` during the <year> pbs documentary the commanding heights ( based on the book ) , friedman continued to argue that `` free markets would undermine [ pinochet 's ] political centralization and political control . `` , and that criticism over his role in chile missed his main contention that freer markets resulted in freer people , and that chile 's unfree economy had caused pinochet 's rise . friedman advocated for free markets which undermined `` political centralization and political control '' .because of his involvement with the government of chile , which was a dictatorship at the time of his visit , there were international protests , spanning from sweden to america when friedman was awarded the nobel memorial prize in <year> . friedman was accused of supporting the military dictatorship in chile because of the relation of economists of the university of chicago to pinochet , and a seven-day trip he took to chile during march <year> ( less than two years after the coup that ended with the death of president salvador allende ) . friedman answered that he was never an advisor to the dictatorship , but only gave some lectures and seminars on inflation , and met with officials , including augusto pinochet the head of the military dictatorship , while in chile . after a <year> speech on drug legalization , friedman answered a question on his involvement with the pinochet regime , saying that he was never an advisor to pinochet ( also mentioned in his <year> iceland interview ) , but that a group university of chicago students were involved in chile 's economic reforms . friedman credited these reforms with high levels of economic growth and with the establishment of democracy that has subsequently occurred in chile . <days> october <year> , after returning from a lecture tour of china during which he had met with zhao ziyang , general secretary of the communist party of china , friedman wrote to the stanford daily asking if he should anticipate a similar `` avalanche of protests for having been willing to give advice to so evil a government ? and if not , why not ? '' === iceland === friedman visited iceland during the autumn of <year> , met with important icelanders and gave a lecture at the university of iceland on the `` tyranny of the status quo . '' he participated in a lively television debate on august <days> , <year> , with socialist intellectuals , including ólafur ragnar grímsson , who later became president of iceland . when they complained that a fee was charged for attending his lecture at the university and that , hitherto , lectures by visiting scholars had been free-of-charge , friedman replied that previous lectures had not been free-of-charge in a meaningful sense : lectures always have related costs . what mattered was whether attendees or non-attendees covered those costs . friedman thought that it was fairer that only those who attended paid . in this discussion friedman also stated that he did not receive any money for delivering that lecture . === estonia === although friedman never visited estonia , his book free to choose influenced estonia 's then <other> prime minister , mart laar , who has claimed that it was the only book on economics he had read before taking office . laar 's reforms are often credited with responsibility for transforming estonia from an impoverished soviet republic to the `` baltic tiger . '' a prime element of laar 's program was introduction of the flat tax . laar won the <year> milton friedman prize for advancing liberty , awarded by the cato institute . === united kingdom === after <year> friedman was frequently invited to lecture in britain , and by the 1970s his ideas had gained widespread attention in conservative circles . for example , he was a regular speaker at the institute of economic affairs ( iea ) , a libertarian think tank . conservative politician margaret thatcher closely followed iea programs and ideas , and met friedman there in <year> . he also strongly influenced keith joseph , who became thatcher 's senior advisor on economic affairs , as well as alan walters and patrick minford , two other key advisers . major newspapers , including the daily telegraph , the times , and the financial times all promulgated friedman 's monetarist ideas to british decision-makers . friedman 's ideas strongly influenced thatcher and her allies when she became prime minister in <year> . === united states === after his death a number of obituaries and articles were written in friedman 's honor , citing him as one of the most important and influential economists of the post-war era . milton friedman 's somewhat controversial legacy in america remains strong within the conservative movement . however , some journalists and economists like noah smith and scott sumner have argued friedman 's academic legacy has been buried under his political philosophy and misinterpreted by modern conservatives . == criticism == econometrician david hendry criticized part of friedman 's and anna schwartz 's <year> monetary trends . when asked about it during an interview with icelandic tv in <year> , friedman said that the criticism referred to a different problem from that which he and schwartz had tackled , and hence was irrelevant , and pointed out the lack of consequential peer review amongst econometricians on hendry 's work . in <year> , hendry said that friedman was guilty of `` serious errors '' of misunderstanding that meant `` the t-ratios he reported for uk money demand were overstated by nearly <integer> per cent '' , and said that , in a paper published in <year> with neil ericsson , he had refuted `` almost every empirical claim ... made about uk money demand '' by friedman and schwartz . a <year> paper updated and confirmed the validity of the hendry–ericsson findings through <year> . some commentators believe that friedman was not open enough , in their view , to the possibility of market inefficiencies . economist noah smith argues that while friedman made many important contributions to economic theory not all of his ideas relating to macroeconomics have entirely held up over the years and that too few people are willing to challenge them.political scientist c.b . macpherson disagreed with friedman 's historical assessment of economic freedom leading to political freedom , suggesting that political freedom actually gave way to economic freedom for property-owning elites . he also challenged the notion that markets efficiently allocated resources and rejected friedman 's definition of liberty . friedman 's positivist methodological approach to economics has also been critiqued and debated . finnish economist uskali mäki argued some of his assumptions were unrealistic and vague.noam chomsky suggested in his book profit over people that the primary role of what some describe as neoliberalism was as an ideological cover for capital accumulation by multinational corporations.friedman has been criticized by some prominent austrian economists , including murray rothbard and walter block . block called friedman a `` socialist '' , and was critical of his support for a central banking system , saying `` first and foremost , this economist supported the federal reserve system all throughout his professional life . that organization of course does not own the money stock , but controls it . friedman was an inveterate hater of the gold standard , denigrating its advocates as 'gold bugs ' . `` although the book was described by the cato institute as among the greatest economics books in the 20th century , and a monetary history of the united states is widely considered to be among the most influential economics books ever made , it has endured criticisms for its conclusion that the federal reserve was to blame for the great depression . some economists , including noted friedman critic peter temin have raised questions about the legitimacy of friedman 's claims about whether or not monetary quantity levels were endogenous rather than exogenously determined , as a monetary history of the united states posits . nobel-prize winning economist paul krugman argued that the <year> recession proved that , during a recession , a central bank can not control broad money ( m3 money , as defined by the oecd ) , and even if it can , the money supply does not bear a direct or proven relationship with gdp . according to krugman , this was true in the 1930s , and the claim that the federal reserve could have avoided the great depression by reacting to what friedman called the great contraction is `` highly dubious '' .james tobin questioned the importance of velocity of money , and how informative this measure of the frequency of transactions is to understanding the various fluctuations observed in a monetary history of the united states.economic historian barry eichengreen argued that because of the gold standard , which was at this point in time the chief monetary system of the world , the federal reserve 's hands were tied . this was because , in order to retain the credibility of the gold standard , the federal reserve could not undertake actions like dramatically expanding the money supply as proposed by friedman and schwartz.austrian economist murray rothbard criticized friedman 's conclusions , and argued they are inconsistent with data , because during the period described by friedman as `` the great contraction , '' the money supply increased . friedman and schwartz argued that the great depression happened as a result of a deflationary spiral which , according to rothbard , is inconsistent with data.lawrence mishel , distinguished fellow of the economic policy institute , argues that wages have been kept low in the united states because of the friedman doctrine , namely the adoption of corporate practices and economic policies ( or the blocking of reforms ) at the behest of business and the wealthy elite , which resulted in the systematic disempowerment of workers . he argues that the lack of worker power caused wage suppression , increased wage inequality , and exacerbated racial disparities . notably , mechanisms such as excessive unemployment , globalization , eroded labor standards ( and their lack of enforcement ) , weakened collective bargaining , and corporate structure changes that disadvantage workers , all collectively functioned to keep wages low . from <year> to <year> , while economy-wide productivity rose almost <integer> percent , hourly compensation for typical workers increased less than <integer> percent , whilst the earnings of the top <integer> percent and 0.1 percent increased <integer> percent and <integer> percent , respectively . == selected

profile and video `` free to choose '' ( <year> ) , a pbs tv series by milton friedman milton friedman at the cato institute free to choose network kelvin john lancaster ( <integer> december <year> – <integer> july <year> ) was an australian mathematical economist and john bates clark professor of economics at columbia university . he is best known for the development of the theory of the second best with richard lipsey . lancaster was also active in developing the calculus of qualitative economics , formulating the household production function , and applying the hedonic model to the estimation of housing prices . in a <year> paper , lancaster developed what he called a `` new theory of consumer demand '' , in which the then standard microeconomic demand theory was modified by stipulating that what consumers are seeking to acquire is not goods themselves ( e.g . cars or train journeys ) but the characteristics they contain ( e.g . transport from a to b , display of fashion sense ) . as palda ( <year> ) explains the second evolution in spatial economics was due to kelvin lancaster . his insight was that the basic qualities that consumers seek could be manipulated by combining different products . hotelling had not considered this possibility . he had been content to accept that one good provided one underlying feature that could be measured in characteristics space . lancaster saw the matter in greater breadth . dinner was not just food on a table . it was an attempt to manipulate the basic constituents of flavor and nutrition into a satisfying gastronomic experience . being a good cook meant knowing that taste had several dimensions including sweet , salty , sour , and savory . for a meal to be agreeable , it had to combine these elements of flavor and it also had to be easily digested , suggesting that nutritional dimensions such as greasiness , protein content , and temperature had to figure into the cook ’ s understanding . these basic culinary entities could each be thought of as lying on a left-right scale , or space . the ideal meal , then , sought to combine these features by varying each one as precisely as possible . this theory provides a convenient account of the difference between less developed ( so called `` primitive '' ) consumption economies , in which there are fewer goods than characteristics , and more developed ( `` sophisticated '' ) consumption economies , in which there are more goods than characteristics , so that consumers can secure any combination of characteristics they desire , subject only to budget constraints . it also provides a way of predicting demand for new commodities , so long as they do not embody any new characteristics.according to economist jagdish bhagwati , `` he was widely regarded as a potential recipient of the nobel prize , for the notable impact that had been made by his contributions to the theory of second best and the integration of variety into economic theory . he joins the list of extraordinary economists such as joan robinson , roy harrod , and mancur olson whom death deprived of this singular honor . `` lancaster attended sydney boys high school , graduating in <year> . == references == == external links == obituary in the new york times talking about a revolution by paul krugman richard errett smalley ( june <days> , <year> – october <days> , <year> ) was the gene and norman hackerman professor of chemistry and a professor of physics and astronomy at rice university . in <year> , along with robert curl , also a professor of chemistry at rice , and harold kroto , a professor at the university of sussex , he was awarded the nobel prize in chemistry for the discovery of a new form of carbon , buckminsterfullerene , also known as buckyballs . he was an advocate of nanotechnology and its applications . == early life and education == smalley , the youngest of <integer> siblings , was born in akron , ohio on june <days> , <year> to frank dudley smalley , jr. , and esther virginia rhoads . he grew up in kansas city , missouri . richard smalley credits his father , mother and aunt as formative influences in industry , science and chemistry . his father , frank dudley smalley , jr. worked with mechanical and electrical equipment and eventually became ceo of a trade journal for farm implements called implement and tractor . his mother , esther rhoads smalley , completed her b.a . degree while richard was a teenager . she was particularly inspired by mathematician norman n. royall jr. , who taught foundations of physical science , and communicated her love of science to her son through long conversations and joint activities . smalley 's maternal aunt , pioneering female chemist sara jane rhoads , interested smalley in the field of chemistry , letting him work in her organic chemistry laboratory , and suggesting that he attend hope college , which had a strong chemistry program.smalley attended hope college for two years before transferring to the university of michigan where he received his bachelor of science in <year> , performing undergraduate research in the laboratory of raoul kopelman . between his studies , he also worked in industry , where he developed his unique managerial style . he received his ph.d. from princeton university in <year> after completing a doctoral dissertation , titled `` the lower electronic states of 1,3,5 ( sym ) -triazine '' , under the supervision of elliot r. bernstein . he did postdoctoral work at the university of chicago from <year> to <year> , with donald levy and lennard wharton where he was a pioneer in the development of supersonic beam laser spectroscopy . == career == in <year> , smalley joined rice university . in <year> , he was appointed to the gene and norman hackerman chair in chemistry at rice . he helped to found the rice quantum institute in <year> , serving as chairman from <year> to <year> . in <year> , he became also a professor in the department of physics . in <year> , he helped to found the center for nanoscale science and technology . in <year> , he was appointed its director.he became a member of the national academy of sciences in <year> , and the american academy of arts and sciences in <year> . === fullerenes === smalley 's research in physical chemistry investigated the formation of inorganic and semiconductor clusters using pulsed molecular beams and time-of-flight mass spectrometry . as a consequence of this expertise , robert curl introduced him to harry kroto in order to investigate a question about the constituents of astronomical dust . these are carbon-rich grains expelled by old stars such as r coronae borealis . the result of this collaboration was the discovery of c60 ( known as buckyballs ) and the fullerenes as the third allotropic form of carbon.the research that earned kroto , smalley and curl the nobel prize mostly comprised three articles . first was the discovery of c60 in the nov. <integer> , <year> , issue of nature , `` c60 : buckminsterfullerene '' . the second article detailed the discovery of the endohedral fullerenes in `` lanthanum complexes of spheroidal carbon shells '' in the journal of the american chemical society ( <year> ) . the third announced the discovery of the fullerenes in `` reactivity of large carbon clusters : spheroidal carbon shells and their possible relevance to the formation and morphology of soot '' in the journal of physical chemistry ( <year> ) .although only three people can be cited for a nobel prize , graduate students james r. heath , yuan liu , and sean c. o'brien participated in the work . smalley mentioned heath and o'brien in his nobel lecture . heath went on to become a professor at the california institute of technology ( caltech ) and o'brien joined texas instruments and is now at memtronics . yuan liu is a senior staff scientist at oak ridge national laboratory.this research is significant for the discovery of a new allotrope of carbon known as a fullerene . other allotropes of carbon include graphite , diamond and graphene . harry kroto 's <year> paper entitled `` c60 : buckminsterfullerine '' , published with colleagues j. r. heath , s. c. o'brien , r. f. curl , and r. e. smalley , was honored by a citation for chemical breakthrough award from the division of history of chemistry of the american chemical society , presented to rice university in <year> . the discovery of fullerenes was recognized in <year> by the designation of a national historic chemical landmark by the american chemical society at the richard e. smalley institute for nanoscale science and technology at rice university in houston , texas . === nanotechnology === following nearly a decade 's worth of research into the formation of alternate fullerene compounds ( e.g . c28 , c70 ) , as well as the synthesis of endohedral metallofullerenes ( m @ c60 ) , reports of the identification of carbon nanotube structures led smalley to begin investigating their iron-catalyzed synthesis.as a consequence of this research , smalley was able to persuade the administration of rice university , under then-president malcolm gillis , to create rice 's center for nanoscale science and technology ( cnst ) focusing on any aspect of molecular nanotechnology . it was renamed the richard e. smalley institute for nanoscale science and technology after smalley 's death in <year> , and has since merged with the rice quantum institute , becoming the smalley-curl institute ( sci ) in 2015.smalley 's latest research was focused on carbon nanotubes , specifically focusing on the chemical synthesis side of nanotube research . he is well known for his group 's invention of the high-pressure carbon monoxide ( hipco ) method of producing large batches of high-quality nanotubes . smalley spun off his work into a company , carbon nanotechnologies inc. and associated nanotechnologies . === dispute on molecular assemblers === he was an outspoken skeptic of the idea of molecular assemblers , as advocated by k. eric drexler . his main scientific objections , which he termed the `` fat fingers problem '' and the `` sticky fingers problem '' , argued against the feasibility of molecular assemblers being able to precisely select and place individual atoms . he also believed that drexler 's speculations about apocalyptic dangers of molecular assemblers threatened the public support for development of nanotechnology . he debated drexler in an exchange of letters which were published in chemical & engineering news as a point-counterpoint feature . == advocacy == starting in the late 1990s , smalley advocated for the need for cheap , clean energy , which he described as the number one problem facing humanity in the 21st century . he described what he called `` the terawatt challenge '' , the need to develop a new power source capable of increasing `` our energy output by a minimum factor of two , the generally agreed-upon number , certainly by the middle of the century , but preferably well before that . `` he also presented a list entitled `` top ten problems of humanity for next <integer> years '' . it can be interesting to compare his list , in order of priority , to the ten threats formulated by the u.n. 's high level threat panel in <year> . smalley 's list , in order of priority , was : energy water food environment poverty terrorism & war disease education democracy populationsmalley regarded several problems as interlinked : the lack of people entering the fields of science and engineering , the need for an alternative to fossil fuels , and the need to address global warming . he felt that improved science education was essential , and strove to encourage young students to consider careers in science . his slogan for this effort was `` be a scientist , save the world . `` smalley was a leading advocate of the national nanotechnology initiative in <year> . suffering from hair loss and weakness as a result of his chemotherapy treatments , smalley testified before the congressional testimonies , arguing for the potential benefits of nanotechnology in the development of targeted cancer therapies . bill <integer> , the 21st century nanotechnology research and development act , was introduced in the senate on january <days> , <year> by senator ron wyden , passed the senate on november <days> , <year> , and at the house of representatives the next day with a 405–19 vote . president george w. bush signed the act into law on december <days> , <year> , as public law <other> <integer> . smalley was invited to attend . == personal life == smalley was married four times , to judith grace sampieri ( <other> ) , mary l. chapieski ( <other> ) , jonell m. chauvin ( <other> ) and deborah sheffield ( <year> ) , and had two sons , chad richard smalley ( born june <days> , <year> ) and preston reed smalley ( born august <days> , <year> ) .in <year> , smalley was diagnosed with cancer . smalley died of leukemia , variously reported as non-hodgkin 's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia , on october <days> , <year> , at m.d . anderson cancer center in houston , texas , at the age of 62.upon smalley 's death , the us senate passed a resolution to honor smalley , crediting him as the `` father of nanotechnology . '' === religion during final years === smalley , who had taken classes in religion as well as science at hope college , rediscovered his religious foundation in later life , particularly during his final years while battling cancer . during the final year of his life , smalley wrote : `` although i suspect i will never fully understand , i now think the answer is very simple : it 's true . god did create the universe about 13.7 billion years ago , and of necessity has involved himself with his creation ever since . `` at the tuskegee university 's 79th annual scholarship convocation/parents ' recognition program he was quoted making the following statement regarding the subject of evolution while urging his audience to take seriously their role as the higher species on this planet . `` 'genesis ' was right , and there was a creation , and that creator is still involved ... we are the only species that can destroy the earth or take care of it and nurture all that live on this very special planet . i 'm urging you to look on these things . for whatever reason , this planet was built specifically for us . working on this planet is an absolute moral code . ... let 's go out and do what we were put on earth to do .

references == valentin sergeyevich pavlov ( russian : валéнтин серге́евич па́влов ; <integer> september <year> – <integer> march <year> ) was a soviet official who became a russian banker following the dissolution of the soviet union . born in the city of moscow , then part of the russian soviet federative socialist republic , pavlov began his political career in the ministry of finance in <year> . later , during the brezhnev era , he became head of the financial department of the state planning committee . pavlov was appointed to the post of chairman of the state committee on prices during the gorbachev era , and later became minister of finance in nikolai ryzhkov 's second government . he went on to succeed ryzhkov as head of government in the newly established post of prime minister of the soviet union . as prime minister pavlov initiated the <year> soviet monetary reform , commonly referred to as the pavlov reform , in early <year> . early on he told the media that the reform was initiated to halt the flow of soviet roubles transported to the soviet union from abroad . although ridiculed at the time , the statement was later proven to be true . <days> june the same year , pavlov called for a transfer of power from the president of the soviet union to the prime minister and the cabinet of ministers . when that failed , he joined a plot to oust gorbachev . in august <days> he participated in the <year> soviet coup d'état attempt , which tried to prevent the disintegration of the soviet union . pavlov was arrested for his involvement in the coup and went on to work in the banking sector in post-soviet russia . he is seen by some as the last legitimate soviet head of government since his successor , ivan silayev , was appointed by the russian soviet federative socialist republic in breach of what his opponents consider to be soviet constitutional principles . == early life and career == born in moscow on <integer> september <year> , pavlov graduated from the moscow finance institute in <year> . he started his nomenklatura ( bureaucratic ) career as a government economist ; he started working for as an official of the ministry of finance in <year> , and became a member of the communist party of the soviet union in <year> . early in his career he also worked for the ministry of finance of the russian soviet federative socialist republic ( rsfsr ) . pavlov started working for the state planning committee in <year> , and became a member of the state planning committee 's board in <year> . he held the office as head of the state planning committee 's finance department , the department which oversaw all aspects of the country 's planned economy . he served as first deputy minister of finance in boris gostev 's ministry from january <days> august 1986.pavlov was appointed chairman of the state committee on prices on <integer> august <year> , and retained that post until <integer> june <year> . throughout the period , and later as minister of finance , pavlov supported the centralised price reform proposal posited by nikolai ryzhkov , chairman of the council of ministers . he succeeded gostev to become minister of finance in ryzhkov 's government in <year> and his time in the post was considered uncontroversial , even though lira rozenova , deputy chairman of the state committee for prices , was not elected to the post of chairman of the state committee for her advocacy of pavlov-backed plans for centrally administered price reform . he was the only minister in ryzhkov 's government who was also a member of the presidium of the council of ministers.along with eduard shevardnadze – soviet foreign minister – pavlov was the only nominee from ryzhkov 's second government to be overwhelmingly elected by the supreme soviet of the soviet union . as minister of finance , pavlov was supportive of the marketisation of the soviet economy , having overseen a rapid increase in the soviet money supply and the increase in inflation it caused . pavlov also set the exchange rate for the rouble against the american dollar on the soviet black market . in <year> he proudly admitted that during his tenure as minister of finance , and later prime minister , he had deceived several western banks and creditors by lying about the soviet union 's gold reserves . in <year> , pavlov gathered together enough information on the errors and omissions of ivan silayev , the future soviet premier and russian sfsr premier , to weaken his position as deputy premier . silayev never forgave pavlov and relations between the two grew even more icy when pavlov became soviet premier . == prime minister == following the resignation of nikolai ryzhkov following a heart attack <days> december <year> , pavlov was elected to the new position of prime minister as a compromise candidate , and became chairman of the cabinet of ministers . he and his two first deputy prime ministers , vladimir velichko and vitaly doguzhiev , were approved and elected by the supreme soviet of the soviet union on <integer> january <days> with <integer> votes in favour , <integer> against , and <integer> abstained , while approval for the majority of his ministers followed within a few weeks . pavlov was considered a conservative upon his election as prime minister , and the soviet press described him as a `` bold and complex man '' who was against full marketisation but who believed that the soviet union was even more oppressive towards workers than even the most advanced capitalist societies . one of his first actions as prime minister was to move the headquarters of the soviet government – the cabinet of ministers – from the moscow kremlin to the former headquarters of the state committee for construction to strengthen his position . === <year> monetary reform === the soviet monetary reform of <year> , commonly referred to as the pavlov reform , was the last monetary reform prior to the dissolution of the soviet union , despite having made a speech <integer> weeks before , saying there would be no such reforms . initiated on <integer> january <year> , it was intended to withdraw money from circulation for reallocation to the production of consumer goods , which were in short supply . in a speech , pavlov stated that the reason for the withdrawal was the government 's belief that money was being sent to the soviet union from abroad , fuelling inflation . although ridiculed by the soviet press at the time , three years later the truth of pavlov 's statement was verified . mikhail gorbachev then signed a presidential decree ordering the soviet financial system to stop accepting and exchanging banknotes issued in <year> . the directive also included <other> and <other> banknotes issued in <year> . on <integer> january <year> , the government began restricting monthly bank deposit withdrawals to <integer> rubles with the official explanation that this was to freeze the income of corrupt officials , capitalists and criminals.under the orders of pavlov , the government freed forty percent of prices on <integer> january <year> , and introduced sales tax of <integer> % . prices of consumer goods , in particular , were now considered free in the sense that negotiation became possible between producers and the distributor . according to philip hanson in his book , the rise and fall of the soviet economy : an economic history of the ussr from <year> , pavlov 's reform was undermined by the union republics who failed to follow pavlov 's orders , along with the widespread existence of local monopolies , which tended to have their own definition of luxury goods and as a result imposed higher prices on such items.soviet citizens had only three days from <integer> to <integer> january <days> exchange their old <integer> rouble and <integer> rouble banknotes for the new currency . exchange could be postponed , but only through specialized government commissions . due to this short exchange window , long queues formed in front of soviet savings banks , even though it was also possible to exchange money at workplaces and post offices . this reform also dealt a crippling blow to soviet citizens who had saved their money and could not move fast enough to get it exchanged ; some lost as much as 15,000 - 30,000 rubles overnight.in the end the reform proved unsuccessful . the government only managed to withdraw <integer> billion rubles from circulation of the country 's money supply against an intended target of 81.5 billion rubles . as a result , the pavlov reform did not put an end to inflation . prices for items including food and transport rose by 100–300 percent , while the soviet standard of living decreased sharply and the state budget deficit increased by an estimated 20–30 percent of gnp . in the aftermath of the reform , inflation exceeded the <integer> percent mark every month . === coup attempt === <days> june <year> , pavlov , who felt that the office of prime minister had limited power , discovered that gorbachev planned to replace him as prime minister . in response , he arrived at the supreme soviet of the soviet union `` visibly nervous '' , and in his report to the supreme soviet , he was forced to tell delegates of the faltering state of the soviet economy . however , pavlov blamed this on the ongoing war of laws between the supreme soviet of the soviet union and the supreme soviet of the russian soviet federative socialist republic ( rsfsr ) , which , he argued , could be resolved by introducing a state of emergency across the entire soviet union , or at least in certain economic sectors.according to pavlov , the union 's problems remained insoluble as long as gorbachev retained so much power and had limited time to address important issues . to break the impasse , pavlov called for a transfer of power from the president of the soviet union to the prime minister and the cabinet of ministers , ( specifically , he wanted the cabinet to have the right to issue decrees on economic affairs without the approval of the president ) , even creating a five-point resolution to that end for the legislature to consider . pavlov received support for the idea from the soyuz parliamentary faction leader viktor alksnis , who called for an immediate vote on the issue . however , several members of soyuz also demanded a statement by the kgb and the ministry of defence to comment on the proposal . in retrospect , alksnis notes that this resolution could have become a coup d'état had pavlov consulted with them earlier . according to historian jerry f. hough , pavlov 's program `` was not directed as much at gorbachev as at [ boris ] yeltsin '' .by the afternoon , the majority of soyuz members favoured an immediate vote . the chairman of the supreme soviet of the soviet union , anatoly lukyanov , had already departed for novo ogarevo to take part in constitutional negotiations and he promised to tell gorbachev about the vote . in his place stood ivan laptev , a pro-gorbachev reformer , who did not trust lukyanov and tried to stall the vote by demanding a statement from the kgb , ministry of the interior and the ministry of defence . according to laptev , the mood was such that if a vote had been taken pavlov would have won . at the time , both the soviet secret police and the military establishment in general wanted to strengthen the authority of the soviet government and so they too supported pavlov 's program . soyuz , through a vote , was able to increase the powers of the cabinet of ministers , and gave the institution the right of legislative initiative.shortly afterwards , jack matlock , united states ambassador to the soviet union , told gorbachev of the possibility of a coup attempt against him , and the soviet leader became worried when anatoly chernyaev informed him of mysterious troop movements outside moscow . on <integer> june <days> four days after pavlov 's speech , gorbachev addressed the supreme soviet and told delegates that there were no differences in opinion between him and pavlov . even when he had been able to secure his position , gorbachev 's power within the system was already faltering , although he succeeded in getting the enhanced powers previously given to the cabinet of ministers reversed . the power struggle between gorbachev and pavlov was not over , with gorbachev , on july <days> , <year> , promising yeltsin and nursultan nazarbayev that pavlov , along with dmitry yazov , minister of defence , and vladimir kryuchkov , the chairman of the kgb , would be removed from their posts following the signing and ratification of the new union treaty , with nazarbayev to be appointed in pavlov 's place as prime minister . === august coup === the <year> soviet coup d'état attempt , commonly referred to as the august coup , was prompted by the slow disintegration of the soviet union that resulted from gorbachev 's reform policy and yeltsin 's drive towards an independent russia . the new union treaty being prepared called for further decentralisation of power to the republics , which weakened the government 's already tenuous hold on the economy . pavlov received a draft of the new union treaty on <integer> august <days> a security council meeting and managed to get it published in the moscow news on <integer> august.opposing the decentralisation stance taken in the treaty , pavlov was one of the key players in the establishment of the state committee for the state of emergency <days> august <year> . pavlov 's inclusion in the committee has been used to demonstrate its unwillingness to revert to pre-gorbachev policies . the committee 's main goal was to ensure that the soviet union continued as a highly centralised union state . the emergency committee was led by gennady yanayev , vice president of the soviet union , interior minister boris pugo , defence minister dmitry yazov and other hardliners who were determined to take action to oust gorbachev.vladimir kryuchkov , the kgb chairman , had told pavlov of the coup on <integer> august <days> one day before it began . he was asked by kryuchkov to meet his co-plotters at the moscow kremlin , where on <integer> august <days> he and his co-conspirators appeared on live television and told the soviet people that gorbachev was indisposed . as the day wore on it soon became apparent that pavlov had been drinking since he issued several contradictory orders and repeated himself . in retrospect he admitted that he had been drinking with his son the day before . on the same day , his fellow plotters decided to depose pavlov , sending him to his dacha where his wife took care of him . as with all the others , pavlov was arrested following the collapse of the coup . shortly after pavlov was hospitalised with hypertension whilst remaining in custody . he was released on recognizance not to leave <days> january <year> and granted amnesty by the russian state duma in <year> . == later life and death == after his release from custody , pavlov became a director of the commercial bank chasprombank between <year> and <year> . he resigned at the request of the bank 's board of directors , who informed him that they had decided `` to provide him an indefinite leave of absence . '' <days> february <year> , shortly after his resignation , the bank 's license was revoked for violating the banking laws set up by the central bank of russia . pavlov then worked as an advisor to promstroibank between <year> and <year> , and in <year> also became a vice president of the american firm business management systems . he worked both as vice president of both the free economic society and the international academy of management and later headed a department of the international union of economists . pavlov died in moscow on <integer> march <year> , and was buried on <integer> april <days> pyatnitskoye cemetery . == decorations == order of the red banner of labour order of the badge of honour == personal life == in <year> with support from viktor gerashchenko , valentin pavlov 's son sergey pavlov ( russian : сергей павлов ) was a banker at east west united bank , luxembourg . == notes == == bibliography == brown , archie ( <year> ) . the gorbachev factor . oxford university press . isbn <days> . huskey , eugene ( <year> ) . executive power and soviet politics : the rise and decline of the soviet state . m.e . sharpe . isbn <days> . hanson , philip ( <year> ) . the rise and fall of the soviet economy : an economic history of the ussr from <year> . pearson education . isbn <days> . hough , jerry ( <year> ) . democratization and revolution in the ussr , 1985–1991 . brookings institution press . isbn <days> . mccauley , martin ( <year> ) . gorbachev . pearson education . isbn <days> . murray , don ( <year> ) . a democracy of despots . mcgill-queen 's press – mqup . isbn <days> . == external links == obituary in the washington post archives ( requires log-in ) george caspar homans ( august <days> , <year> – may <days> , <year> ) was an american sociologist , founder of behavioral sociology and a major contributor to the social exchange theory . homans is best known for his research in social behavior and his works : the human group , social behavior : its elementary forms , his exchange theory and the many different propositions he made to better explain social behavior . == biography == george c. homans was a humanist and sociologist , some might say the last of a generation . born in boston on august <days> , <year> , he grew up in a little house in francis avenue , cambridge massachusetts , son of robert homans and abigail-abigail adams homans ( one can get complete sense of george c. homans ' upbringing by reading her biography education by uncles ) . although he was one of sociology 's greatest minds he had no graduate degrees in sociology or any other subject for that matter . moreover , he was never properly trained because he believed that training was exclusively for dogs . nevertheless , he educated himself by reading and listening to his peers and by conducting extensive `` field work '' in observing various social groups and became the president of the american sociological association . he was the great-great grandson of john quincy adams , the sixth president of the united states , and great-great-great grandson of john adams , the second president of the united states . at george 's birth , his mother wrote to her uncle henry : 'his head is a mass of lumps which will make him look very distinguished when , as a bald old gentleman , he sits upon the bench dispensing justice . ' '' george did not talk about the adamses , yet had distinctively visible features in his skull that came from the adamses . the homanses , his father 's family represented a different skein of public and service , the tradition of professions . for generations the family focused on two professions , medical practice and law . the homans ' came from a lineage of distinguished doctors that began when the first john homans came to the country from ramsgate , kent , england in the 18th century . his son , dr. john homans , harvard university graduate , was the first to become a doctor and begin the reputation of the john homanses ( homans <other> ) . `` george 's father was a lawyer , but george was the first member of the family to eschew the law '' . == personal life == homans attended st. paul 's school in concord , new hampshire , from <year> to 1928.from his autobiography ( homans <year> ) , it is learned that homans entered harvard college in <year> with a concentration in english and american literature . during his undergraduate years pursued poetry and had developed a grand ambition to become a writer and poet . george published his original works in the harvard advocate , in which he was elected into the editorial board . after graduating in <year> , homans wanted to pursue a career as a newspaperman with a `` job beginning in the fall with william allen white of the emporia , kansas , gazette , '' but because of the depression the newspaper could no longer offer him the job , leaving homans unemployed ( homans <other> ) . `` in <year> , he married nancy parshall cooper who remained his lifelong compatible partner '' .homans served in the naval reserve ( <year> ) he always had a love for the sea , as an undergraduate he assisted on helping samuel eliot morrison in writing massachusetts on the sea , so much so that morrison named homans co-author . george served four years and a half on active duty , serving five years in the navy in total , more than tow were spent in command of several small ships engaged in anti submarine warfare and the escort of convoy operations ( homans <other> ) . although he served for the duration of the war , in his autobiography coming to my senses : the education of sociologist ( <year> ) , he later expressed his `` impatience with the constraints of the naval hierarchy and his disdain for staff desk officers , especially those in bureaucratic branches such as the supply corps '' . == education and becoming a sociologist == while homans was at harvard college , where he spent most of his time along the banks of charles , in harvard george met the person that directly influenced his life . bernard ( `` benny '' ) de voto , `` a crusty man , cantankerous in his literary feuds whose name has been largely forgotten '' was a part-time member of the harvard faculty and tutored homans in english . `` george ... was attracted to de voto 's stories about the plains and the prairies , but more , to the actuality of the lives of people and the american character as expressed in midwestern writing . in many ways , too , `` george adopted the mannerisms of de voto , the outwardly boisterous tones ( but not for either the boosterist mentality ) and the scorn of intellectualist rhetoric '' . outwardly jaunty and self-assured , yet discreetly battling his own demons within his closed heart . he reserved all his pain and suffering for his poetry , which is seen in his book of poetry the witch hazel ( <year> ) . homans became interested in sociology by living in an environment where people are highly conscious of social relations . homans describes his entrance to sociology as `` a matter of chance ; or rather , i got into sociology because i had nothing better to do '' ( homans <other> ) . lawrence joseph henderson , a biochemist and sociologist who believed that all sciences should be based on a unified set of theoretical and methodological principles , was an important influencer on homans ' perspective . homans , with no job and nothing to do , attended henderson 's seminar at harvard one day and was immediately taken by his lecture . homans was also influenced by professor elton mayo , where he was assigned to readings by prominent social anthropologists . from these readings , homans developed his belief that instead of similarities in cultures , `` members of the human species working in similar circumstances had independently created the similar institutions . `` as a result , homans joined a discussion group at harvard called the pareto circle , which was led by henderson and inspired by the work of vilfredo pareto . henderson often discussed vilfredo pareto in his lectures . pareto was a sociologist concerned with economic distribution . pareto 's theories and henderson 's lectures influenced homans ' first book , an introduction to pareto , co-authored with fellow circle member charles p. curtis . from <year> to <year> homans was selected to become a part of the society of fellows a newly formed institution founded by a. lawrence lowell at harvard , undertaking a variety of studies in various areas , including sociology , psychology , and history . his comrades in the institution included , van quine , andrew gleason and b.f. skinner most of whom went on to become harvard professors . in the institution the companions educated each other , george learned the most form his companion b.f. skinner . skinner taught homans about the method of meticulous observation and the idea of reinforcement . `` one can say that , in nunc , george homans 's sociology was a blend of skinnerian reinforcement with utility theory . '' for his junior fellowship project homans undertook an anthropological study of rural england , later published as english villagers of the thirteenth century ( <year> ) which he wrote in lieu of a ph.d. that he never received . ( see homans <year> : <integer> ) . homans was taken into the graduate program at harvard ; pitirim sorokin , founder of harvard 's sociology department in <year> , was credited with bringing homans and robert merton into the program . from this knowledge gained , `` the key idea that homans took away from these studies was the centrality of interaction and the way sentiments developed between individuals as a consequence on interaction . '' == teaching == in <year> homans became a harvard faculty member , a lifelong affiliation in which he taught both sociology and medieval history `` as well as studied poetry and small groups . '' this teaching brought him in contact with new works in industrial sociology and exposed him to works of functional anthropologists . he was an instructor of sociology until <year> when he left to serve in the u.s. navy to support the war effort . after four years away , he came back to boston and continued his teaching as an associate professor from <year> to <year> , and a full professor of sociology after <year> . he was a ford foundation fellow at harvard 's graduate school of business administration . he was also a visiting professor at the university of manchester in <year> , at cambridge university from <year> to <year> , and at the university of kent in <year> . by virtue of his theoretical writings ( discussed below ) , he was elected 54th president of the american sociological association in <year> . he retired from teaching in <year> . == theoretical agenda and general argument == as a theorist , homans ' overall intellectual ambition was to create a more unified social science on a firm theoretical basis . his approach to theory developed in two phases , usually interpreted by commentators as inductive and deductive . although this is a bit of an oversimplification , it provides a framework for outlining his theoretical contributions . in its mature ( <year> ) form , homans ' theory rests upon two metatheoretical claims : ( <integer> ) the basic principles of social science must be true of individuals as members of the human species , not as members of particular groups or cultures ; and ( <integer> ) any other generalizations or facts about human social life will be derivable from these principles ( and suitable initial conditions ) . he argued that large-scale structures can be understood if we understand elementary social behavior.another way to grasp his argument is to interpret it as striving to explain spontaneous social order , a point developed in detail by fararo ( <year> ) . homans ' approach is an example of methodological individualism in social science , also favored by some more recent influential social theorists , particularly those who have adopted some form of rational choice theory ( e.g. , james s. coleman ) that enables greater deductive fertility in theorizing—albeit often with a cost in terms of some loss of realism . == the human group == homans was impressed by henderson 's notion of a conceptual scheme . a conceptual scheme consists of a classification of variables ( or concepts ) that need to be taken into account when studying a set of phenomena . it also consists of a sketch of the given conditions within which the phenomena are to be analyzed . it also must contain a statement that the variables are related to one another—and following pareto , that relationship is usually seen as one of mutual dependence.homans was very interested in henderson 's conceptual scheme as a way of classifying phenomena and applied it to his own study of small groups . henderson 's teachings were included in homans ' work the human group ( <year> ) . this book 's ultimate goal was to move from a study of the social system as it is exemplified in single groups toward a study of the system as it is exemplified in many groups , including groups changing in time . the work has a theme of , `` the way group norms develop and the ways a group , consciously or unconsciously , seeks to maintain the cohesion of the group when members depart from group norms . '' homans establishes that , `` the general propositions would have to meet only one condition : in accordance with my original insight , they should apply to individual human beings as members of a species . `` homans said , `` if we wanted to establish the reality of a social system as a complex of mutually dependent elements , why not begin by studying a system small enough so that we could , so to speak , see all the way around it , small enough so that all the relevant observations could be made in detail and at first hand ? '' he fulfilled this study throughout the human group . this book allowed him to make certain generalizations , including the idea that the more frequently people interact with one another , when no one individually initiates interactions more than others , the greater is their liking for one another and their feeling of ease in one another 's presence . although this was n't homans ' greatest piece of work , it allowed him to become more familiar with this type of methodology and led him to explain elementary social behavior . in this work , homans also proposes that social reality should be described at three levels : social events , customs , and analytical hypotheses that describe the processes by which customs arise and are maintained or changed . hypotheses are formulated in terms of relationships among variables such as frequency of interaction , similarity of activities , intensity of sentiment , and conformity to norms . using notable sociological and anthropological field studies as the grounding for such general ideas , the book makes a persuasive case for treating groups as social systems that can be analyzed in terms of a verbal analogue of the mathematical method of studying equilibrium and stability of systems . in his theoretical analyses of these groups , he begins to use ideas that later loomed large in his work , e.g. , reinforcement and exchange . along the way , he treats important general phenomena such as social control , authority , reciprocity , and ritual . == the exchange theory == the exchange theory is the `` perspective that individuals seek to maximize their own private gratifications . it assumes that these rewards can only be found in social interactions and thus people seek rewards in their interactions with each other '' . homans ' exchange theory propositions are partially based on b.f. skinner 's behaviorism . homans took b.f. skinner 's propositions about pigeon behavior and applied it to human interactions.the heart of homans ' exchange theory lies in propositions based on economic and psychological principles . according to homans , they are psychological for two reasons : first , because they are usually tested on people who call themselves psychologists and second , because of the level at which they deal with the individual in society . he believed that a sociology built on his principles would be able to explain all social behavior . homans said , `` an incidental advantage of an exchange theory is that it might bring sociology closer to economics '' ( homans <other> ) . overall , homans ' exchange theory , `` can be condensed to a view of the actor as a rational profit seeker . `` he regretted that his theory was labeled `` exchange theory '' because he saw this theory of social behavior as a behavioral psychology applied to specific situations . homans looked to émile durkheim 's work for guidance as well , but often disagreed in the end with particular components of durkheim 's theories . for example , durkheim believed that although individuals are clearly the component parts of society , society is more than the individuals who constitute it . he believed that society could be studied without reducing it to individuals and their motivations . homans , through his exchange theory , believed that individual beings and behavior are relevant to understanding society . == albert chavannes and the exchange theory == although george homans contributed greatly to the exchange theory and his work on it is greatly admired , he was not the first person to study this theory . `` from <year> to <year> albert chavannes published in the sociologist a series of papers titled 'studies in sociology ' which treated 'the law of exchange ' and three other social laws . '' chavannes ' work on the theory was similar to what homans did . however , he focused more on empirical sociology , and he did not contribute to it in the same way as homans ( knox <year> : <integer> ) . although homans may have not have been the first to work on this theory , his contributions make the exchange theory what it is today . == social behavior == homans 's next major work was social behavior : its elementary forms . he wrote this book in <year> and revised it in <year> . this was based on the principles of behavioral psychology , and helped explain the `` sub-institutional , '' or elementary , forms of social behavior in small groups . this explanation of social behavior first appeared in an article homans published titled `` social behavior as exchange '' in <year> . he believed his exchange theory was derived from both behavioral psychology and elementary economics.homans had come to the view that theory should be expressed as a deductive system , in this respect falling under the influence of the logical empiricist philosophers of that period . substantively , he argued that a satisfactory explanation in the social sciences is based upon `` propositions '' —principles—about individual behavior that are drawn from the behavioral psychology of the time . homans did n't believe that new propositions are needed to explain social behavior . the laws of individual behavior developed by skinner in his study of pigeons explain social behavior as long as we take into account the complications of mutual reinforcement . `` social behavior is an exchange of goods , material goods , but also non-material ones , such as the symbols of approval or prestige . persons that give much to others try to get much from them , and persons that get much from others are under pressure to give much to them . '' ( homans <other> ) . social behavior as exchange means that a plurality of individuals , each postulated to behave according to the stated behavioral principles , form a system of interaction . social approval is the basic reward that people can give to one another . in much greater detail , he developed this approach in his book social behavior : its elementary forms ( <year> , revised <year> ) . homans gives an example of this type of social behavior below : `` suppose that two men are doing paperwork jobs in an office . according to the office rules , each should do his job by himself , or , if he needs help , he should consult the supervisor . one of the men , whom we shall call person , is not skillful at the work and would get it done better and faster if he got help from time to time . in spite of the rules he is reluctant to go to the supervisor , for to confess his incompetence might hurt his chances for promotion . instead he seeks out the other man , whom we shall call other for short , and asks him for help . other is more experienced at the work than is person ; he can do his work well and quickly and be left with time to spare , and he has reason to suppose that the supervisor will not go out of his way to look for a breach of rules . other gives person help and in return person gives other thanks and expressions of approval . the two men have exchanged help and approval . '' ( homans , <other> ) focusing on this situation , and basing his ideas on skinner 's findings , homans developed several propositions . == the success proposition == `` for all actions taken by persons , the more often a particular action of a person is rewarded , the more likely the person is to perform that action . '' ( homans , <other> ) in terms of his `` person-other '' example , this proposition means that a person is more likely to ask others for advice if past advice has been useful . also , the more often a person received useful advice in the past , the more often they will request more advice and be willing to give advice . the success proposition involves three stages : ( <integer> ) a person 's action , ( <integer> ) a rewarded result , and ( <integer> ) a repetition of the original action . == the stimulus proposition == `` if in the past the occurrence of a particular stimulus , or set of stimuli , has been the occasion on which a person 's action has been rewarded , then the more similar the present stimuli are to the past ones , the more likely the person is to perform the action , or some similar action . '' ( homans , <other> ) one may look at homans ' example : if in the past , the person and other found the giving and getting of advice rewarding , they are likely to engage in similar actions and in similar situations in the future . homans ' example : `` a fisherman who has cast his line into a dark pool and has caught a fish becomes more apt to fish in dark pools again '' ( <other> ) . homans was interested in the process of generalization , or the tendency to extend behavior to similar circumstances ; but he was also concerned with the process of discrimination . for example , person and other may only give useful advice in the same room as in the past because they think that particular situation brought the most success . == the value proposition == `` the more valuable to a person is the result of his action , the more likely he is to perform the action . '' ( homans , <other> ) if the rewards each offers to the other are considered valuable , the actors are more likely to perform the desired behaviors than they are if the rewards are not valuable . homans introduced the concepts of rewards and punishments . rewards are actions with positive values and punishments are actions with negative values . rewards can either be materialistic ( money ) or altruistic ( helping others ) he found punishment to be an inefficient means of getting people to change their behavior , because people may react in undesirable ways to punishment . == the deprivation-satiation proposition == `` the more often in the recent past a person has received a particular reward , the less valuable any further unit of that reward becomes for him . '' ( homans , <other> ) in the office , person and other may reward each other so often for giving and getting advice that the rewards cease to be valuable to them . time is important—people are less likely to become satiated if particular rewards are stretched over a long period of time . homans then defined cost and profit . cost of any behavior is defined as the rewards lost in forgoing alternative lines of action . profit in social exchange is seen as the greater number of rewards gained over costs incurred . == the aggression-approval propositions == `` proposition a : when a person 's action does not receive the rewards as expected , or receives punishment he did not expect , he will be angry . he becomes more likely to perform aggressive havior [ sic ] , and the results of such behavior become more valuable to him . '' ( homans , <other> ) if person does not get the advice they expected and other does not receive the praise they anticipated , both are likely to be angry . `` proposition b : when a person 's action receives the reward they expected , especially a greater reward than they expected , or does not receive punishment he expected , he will be pleased . he becomes more likely to perform approving behavior , and the results of such behavior become more valuable to him . '' ( homans , <other> ) when person gets the advice they expect , and other gets the praise they expect , both are more likely to get or give advice . proposition a on aggression-approval refers to negative emotions , whereas proposition b deals with positive emotions . == the rationality proposition == `` in choosing between alternative actions , a person will choose that one for which , as perceived by him at the time , the value , v , of the result , multiplied by the probability , p , of getting the result , is the greater . '' ( homans , <other> ) when earlier propositions rely on behaviorism , the rationality proposition demonstrates the influence of rational choice theory on homans ' approach . in economic terms , actors who act in accord with the rationality proposition are maximizing their utilities . people examine and make calculations about alternative actions open to them . they compare the amount of rewards associated with each course of action and calculate the likelihood that they will receive the rewards.in other words , there is a relationship between the value of the reward and the likelihood of the attainment . the rationality proposition tells us that people will perform an action depending on their perception of the probability of success . durkheim agreed with homans ' understanding of rationality . he believed that rationalism is an aspect of individualism . durkheim said that all development of individualism has the effect of opening moral consciousness to new ideas and rendering it more demanding . homans worked off of durkheim 's thoughts throughout the development of certain propositions . == legacy == he died of a heart ailment on may <days> , <year> , in cambridge , massachusetts ; at his death , he left behind his wife , nancy , and three children as well as four grandchildren . george c. homans left to the sociological world many works on social theory , and is best known for his exchange theory and his works on social behavior . the impact he had on his students and colleagues and people he came in contact with is described by charles tilly in `` george caspar homans and the rest of us '' : `` his students inherited distrust of theory for its own sake and theories about theories . even when they disagreed , his students and readers came away stimulated and refreshed . george was a vivifier , a life-giver '' ( tilly , <other> ) . also , homans ' election as president of the american sociological association in <year> allowed him to have a greater impact on sociology . as tilly also noted : `` his differences made a difference to us , his colleagues , his friends , and successors . george was not , it is true , above rejoicing in his own talents , and thereby shaming or intimidating those about him '' ( tilly , <other> ) . == quotes by homans == `` sociology is the profession of studying and teaching about what happens when at least two persons are in a position to influence one another '' ( homans , <other> ) `` given the chance , i have always deserted anything that might have contemporary practical importance or that might lead to reforms . i have deserted the twentieth century for the thirteenth , social pathology for primitive kinship , industrial sociology for the study of small groups . <days> may have been mere escapism ... my nerves may have been too weak for the modern world . what never failed to interest me was not sociology as an agent of change or as a means of understanding my immediate environment but sociology as a generalizing science . what were the best possibilities for establishing generalizations ? what were the main intellectual issues ? by what handle shall we lay hold on it ? `` `` as far as what good my work does people , i ’ m sorry to say that it does much more by way of alerting people to what may <days> wrong than it does in telling them what they can do about it . `` `` when you ’ re talking about reforming an industrial system , you have to talk about something that can be operated across the board . with much attention , very skilled people , small groups , reform always can be successful in some sense . but then people jump from this to something that ’ s going to operate across the board and reform the whole industrial system . they forget the homans principle that no society , no governmental system , or no industrial system can work successfully if it depends on extraordinary abilities on the part of the people who run it . it has to be operable by ordinary damn fools like me . `` `` in human terms , it is hopeless . all of us believe in determinism at times—that is , experimentally believe in it . at other times , we believe we ’ re free . our behavior is completely , but it doesn ’ t make damn bit of difference to me because i can ’ t predict it . i can ’ t show how the behavior of different men , behavior of exemplifying the same general propositions , combines over time to produce particular results . the trouble is that the past behavior that affects—determines if you will—present behavior is linked together in complex chains , creating the illusion of freedom .

the ways which firms grow and how fast they do . writing in the independent , the economist sir alec cairncross stated that the book brought dr. penrose `` instant recognition as a creative thinker , and its importance to the analysis of the job of management has been increasingly realized '' . == biography == === personal and marital life === edith tilton was born on <integer> november <year> at sunset boulevard in los angeles . she received a bachelor 's degree in <year> from the university of california at berkeley . in <year> she married david burton denhardt , who died two years later in a hunting accident , leaving her with an infant son . she moved to baltimore , and took her ma and phd under the supervision of fritz machlup at johns hopkins university . in <year> she married ernest

penrose received an honorary doctorate from the faculty of social sciences at uppsala university , sweden . her first book , economics of the international patent system , was published in <year> . === mccarthyism and departure from us === dr. penrose was a lecturer and research associate at johns hopkins university for many years . when fellow academic owen lattimore was accused by senator joseph mccarthy of being a soviet spy , penrose and her husband played a central role in his defence . because of this experience , penrose became disillusioned with the us and the couple went on sabbatical leave , first to the australian national university in canberra and then to baghdad university . === baghdad and the oil industry === while in baghdad , penrose saw an opportunity to study the economics of the oil industry . this work culminated in a book , the large international firm in developing countries : the international petroleum industry , which was published in <year> . after the overthrow of the hashemite monarchy , the couple were expelled from iraq and drove across the syrian desert , through turkey and on to the uk . === move to uk === in <year> , she took a joint

growth of firms . she came to the conclusion that the existing theory of the firm was inadequate to explain how firms grow . her insight was to realize that the 'firm ' in theory is not the same thing as 'flesh and blood ' organizations that businessmen call firms . this insight eventually led to the publication of her second book , the theory of the growth of the firm in <year> . in the introduction to the book , she writes : `` all the evidence we have indicates that the growth of firms is connected with the attempts of a particular group of human beings to do something . '' in theorizing about companies that grow , dr. penrose wrote : `` there are important administrative restraints on the speed of the firm 's growth . human resources required for the management of change are tied to the individual firm and so are internally scarce . expansion requires the recruitment of more such resources . new recruits can not become fully effective overnight . the growth process is , therefore , dynamically constrained . '' === resource-based view of the firm === penrose is considered to be the first economist who posited what has become known as the resource-based view of the firm . strategic resources are those which are rare , difficult to duplicate , valuable , and over which a firm has control . resources can be raw materials , such as a gold mine or oil well , or intellectual , such as patents , and even trademarks and brands ( such as the valuation of the coca-cola brand ) . == published works == the economics of the international patent system , baltimore , johns hopkins press , <year> , isbn <days> the theory of the growth of the firm , new york , john wiley and sons , <year> , isbn <days> the growth of the firm—a case study : the hercules powder company , business history review , volume <integer> spring issue , s. <other> , <year> the large international firm in developing countries : the international petroleum industry , london , allen & unwin , <year> , isbn <days> new orientations : essays in international relations , with peter lyon , frank cass & co , <year> , isbn <days> iraq : international relations and national development , with ernest penrose , boulder , westview press , <year> , isbn <days> == notes == == bibliography == penrose , angela ( <year> ) . no ordinary woman : the life of edith penrose . oxford : oxford university press . isbn <other> . == external links == dr. lászló kákosy ( budapest , <integer> august <year> – budapest , <integer> january <year> ) was a hungarian egyptologist , a member of the hungarian academy of sciences . he is one of the most esteemed hungarian egyptologists and was the author and translator of several books and publications . he went to the ferenc rákóczi high school between 1947–1951 then studied archaeology at eötvös loránd university where he received a degree in <year> . he spent the next three years working at the egyptology department of the hungarian museum of fine arts . in <year> he started teaching at the egyptology department of eötvös university , and from <year> he was the senior lecturer at the department . in <year> he received his doctoral degree ( thesis title : világnézet és valláspolitika az egyiptomi újbirodalom idején és a későkorban – `` worldview and religious politics during the egyptian new kingdom and late period '' ) . he was a corresponding member of the hungarian academy of sciences ( from <year> ;

'' in the event , slesser and hunt were joint leaders of the british party , which mounted a joint expedition with the soviets with the goal of climbing ismoil somoni peak . the animosity between the scots and the english was exceeded by that between the british and the soviets . early on , two of the climbers – robin smith and wilfrid noyce – were killed , and hunt went home . slessor 's best known book , red peak , chronicled the expedition.slesser died while walking on the ardnish peninsula at loch ailort in the scottish highlands . it is suspected he suffered a heart attack . his family erected a cairn on the spot he died .

reglus neves freire ( <integer> september <year> – <integer> may <year> ) was a brazilian educator and philosopher who was a leading advocate of critical pedagogy . his influential work pedagogy of the oppressed is generally considered one of the foundational texts of the critical pedagogy movement , and was the third most cited book in the social sciences as of <year> according to google scholar . == biography == freire was born on <integer> september <year> to a middle-class family in recife , the capital of the northeastern brazilian state of pernambuco . he became familiar with poverty and hunger from an early age as a result of the great depression . in <year> his family moved to the more affordable city of jaboatão dos guararapes , <integer> km west of recife . his father died on <integer> october 1934.during his childhood and adolescence , freire ended up four grades behind , and his social life revolved around playing pick-up football with other poor children , from whom he claims to have learned a great deal . these experiences would shape his concerns for the poor and would help to construct his particular educational viewpoint . freire stated that poverty and hunger severely affected his ability to learn . these experiences influenced his decision to dedicate his life to improving the lives of the poor : `` i did n't understand anything because of my hunger . i was n't dumb . it was n't lack of interest . my social condition did n't allow me to have an education . experience showed me once again the relationship between social class and knowledge '' . eventually , his family 's misfortunes turned around and their prospects improved.freire enrolled in law school at the university of recife in <year> . he also studied philosophy , more specifically phenomenology , and the psychology of language . although admitted to the legal bar , he never practiced law and instead worked as a secondary school portuguese teacher . in <year> , he married elza maia costa de oliveira , a fellow teacher . the two worked together and had five children.in <year> , freire was appointed director of the pernambuco department of education and culture . working primarily among the illiterate poor , freire began to develop an educational praxis that would have an influence on the liberation theology movement of the 1970s . in 1940s brazil , literacy was a requirement for voting in presidential elections . in <year> , he was appointed director of the department of cultural extension at the university of recife . in <year> , he had the first opportunity for large-scale application of his theories , when , in an experiment , <integer> sugarcane harvesters were taught to read and write in just <integer> days . in response to this experiment , the brazilian government approved the creation of thousands of cultural circles across the country.the <year> brazilian coup d'état put an end to freire 's literacy effort , as the ruling military junta did not endorse it . freire was subsequently imprisoned as a traitor for <integer> days . after a brief exile in bolivia , freire worked in chile for five years for the christian democratic agrarian reform movement and the united nations food and agriculture organization . in <year> , freire published his first book , education as the practice of freedom . he followed it up with his most famous work , pedagogy of the oppressed , which was first published in <year> . after a positive international reception of his work , freire was offered a visiting professorship at harvard university in <year> . the next year , pedagogy of the oppressed was published in spanish and english , vastly expanding its reach . because of political feuds between freire , a christian socialist , and brazil 's successive right-wing authoritarian military governments , the book went unpublished in brazil until <year> , when , starting with the presidency of ernesto geisel , the military junta started a process of slow and controlled political liberalisation.following a year in cambridge , massachusetts , freire moved to geneva to work as a special education advisor to the world council of churches . during this time freire acted as an advisor on education reform in several former portuguese colonies in africa , particularly guinea-bissau and mozambique . in <year> , he first visited brazil after more than a decade of exile , eventually moving back in <year> . freire joined the workers ' party ( pt ) in são paulo and acted as a supervisor for its adult literacy project from <year> to <year> . when the workers ' party won the <year> são paulo mayoral elections in <year> , freire was appointed municipal secretary of education . freire died of heart failure on <integer> may <year> , in são paulo . == pedagogy == there is no such thing as a neutral education process . education either functions as an instrument which is used to facilitate the integration of generations into the logic of the present system and bring about conformity to it , or it becomes the `` practice of freedom '' , the means by which men and women deal critically with reality and discover how to participate in the transformation of their world . paulo freire contributed a philosophy of education which blended classical approaches stemming from plato and modern marxist , post-marxist , and anti-colonialist thinkers . his pedagogy of the oppressed ( <year> ) can be read as an extension of , or reply to , frantz fanon 's the wretched of the earth ( <year> ) , which emphasized the need to provide native populations with an education which was simultaneously new and modern , rather than traditional , and anti-colonial – not simply an extension of the colonizing culture . in pedagogy of the oppressed , freire , reprising the oppressors–oppressed distinction , applies the distinction to education , championing that education should allow the oppressed to regain their sense of humanity , in turn overcoming their condition . nevertheless , he acknowledges that for this to occur , the oppressed individual must play a role in their liberation . no pedagogy which is truly liberating can remain distant from the oppressed by treating them as unfortunates and by presenting for their emulation models from among the oppressors . the oppressed must be their own example in the struggle for their redemption . likewise , oppressors must be willing to rethink their way of life and to examine their own role in oppression if true liberation is to occur : `` those who authentically commit themselves to the people must re-examine themselves constantly '' .freire believed education could not be divorced from politics ; the act of teaching and learning are considered political acts in and of themselves . freire defined this connection as a main tenet of critical pedagogy . teachers and students must be made aware of the politics that surround education . the way students are taught and what they are taught serves a political agenda . teachers , themselves , have political notions they bring into the classroom . freire believed that education makes sense because women and men learn that through learning they can make and remake themselves , because women and men are able to take responsibility for themselves as beings capable of knowing—of knowing that they know and knowing that they do n't . === criticism of the `` banking model '' of education === in terms of pedagogy , freire is best known for his attack on what he called the `` banking '' concept of education , in which students are viewed as empty accounts to be filled by teachers . he notes that `` it transforms students into receiving objects [ and ] attempts to control thinking and action , lead [ ing ] men and women to adjust to the world , inhibit [ ing ] their creative power . '' the basic critique was not entirely novel , and paralleled jean-jacques rousseau 's conception of children as active learners , as opposed to a tabula rasa view , more akin to the banking model . john dewey was also strongly critical of the transmission of mere facts as the goal of education . dewey often described education as a mechanism for social change , stating that `` education is a regulation of the process of coming to share in the social consciousness ; and that the adjustment of individual activity on the basis of this social consciousness is the only sure method of social reconstruction '' . freire 's work revived this view and placed it in context with contemporary theories and practices of education , laying the foundation for what would later be termed critical pedagogy . === culture of silence === according to freire , unequal social relations create a `` culture of silence '' that instill a negative , passive and suppressed self-image onto the oppressed , and learners must , then , develop a critical consciousness in order to recognize that this culture of silence is created to oppress . a culture of silence can also cause the `` dominated individuals [ to ] lose the means by which to critically respond to the culture that is forced on them by a dominant culture . `` he considers social , race and class dynamics to be interlaced into the conventional education system , through which this culture of silence eliminates the `` paths of thought that lead to a language of critique . '' == legacy and impact == since the publication of the english-language edition in <year> , pedagogy of the oppressed has had a large impact in education and pedagogy worldwide , especially as a defining work of critical pedagogy . according to israeli writer and education reform theorist sol stern , it has `` achieved near-iconic status in america 's teacher-training programs '' . connections have also been made between freire 's non-dualism theory in pedagogy and eastern philosophical traditions such as the advaita vedanta.in <year> , the adult learning project , based on freire 's work , was established in the gorgie-dalry neighbourhood of edinburgh , scotland . this project had the participation of approximately <integer> people in the first years , and had among its aims to provide affordable and relevant local learning opportunities and to build a network of local tutors . in scotland , freire 's ideas of popular education influenced activist movements not only in edinburgh but also in glasgow.freire 's major exponents in north america are henry giroux , peter mclaren , donaldo macedo , antonia darder , joe l. kincheloe , carlos alberto torres , ira shor , and shirley r. steinberg . one of mclaren 's edited texts , paulo freire : a critical encounter , expounds upon freire 's impact in the field of critical pedagogy . mclaren has also provided a comparative study concerning paulo freire and argentinian revolutionary icon che guevara . freire 's work influenced the radical math movement in the united states , which emphasizes social justice issues and critical pedagogy as components of mathematical curricula.in south africa , freire 's ideas and methods were central to the 1970s black consciousness movement , often associated with steve biko , as well as the trade union movement in the 1970s and 1980s , and the united democratic front in the 1980s . there is a paulo freire project at the university of kwazulu-natal in pietermaritzburg.in <year> , the paulo freire institute was established in são paulo to extend and elaborate upon his theories of popular education . the institute has started projects in many countries and is headquartered at the ucla graduate school of education and information studies , where it actively maintains the freire archives . its director is ucla professor carlos torres , the author of several freirean works , including the <year> a praxis educativa de paulo freire.in <year> paulo , a national training organisation named in honour of freire , was established in the united kingdom . this agency was approved by the new labour government to represent some 300,000 community-based education practitioners working across the uk . paulo was given formal responsibility for setting the occupational training standards for people working in this field.the paulo and nita freire project for international critical pedagogy was founded at mcgill university . here joe l. kincheloe and shirley r. steinberg worked to create a dialogical forum for critical scholars around the world to promote research and re-create a freirean pedagogy in a multinational domain . after the death of kincheloe the project was transformed into a virtual global resource.in <year> , a group of educators in western massachusetts , united states , received permission to name a public school after freire . the holyoke , massachusetts , paulo freire social justice charter school opened <days> september <year> . the school moved to the former pope francis catholic high school building in chicopee , massachusetts , in 2019.in <year> , paolo freire charter high school opened in newark , new jersey . the state closed the school in <year> due to lagging test scores and lack of `` instructional rigor . `` shortly before his death , freire was working on a book of ecopedagogy , a platform of work carried on by many of the freire institutes and freirean associations around the world today . it has been influential in helping to develop planetary education projects such as the earth charter as well as countless international grassroots campaigns in the spirit of freirean popular education generally.freirean literacy methods have been adopted throughout the developing world . in the philippines , catholic `` basal christian communities '' adopted freire 's methods in community education . papua new guinea , freirean literacy methods were used as part of the world bank funded southern highlands rural development program 's literacy campaign . freirean approaches also lie at the heart of the `` dragon dreaming '' approach to community programs that have spread to <integer> countries by <year> . === awards and honors === king baudouin international development

'' indeed , under the rule of stalin , leading geneticists who believed in darwinian evolution and mendelian genetics were considered enemies of the state . several of them were sent to prison , and at least one , nikolai vavilov , was sentenced to death , and died of starvation in prison in <year> . == early career == the next year , belyayev graduated from the ivanovo agricultural institute and began working in the department of fur animal breeding at the central research laboratory in moscow , which was affiliated with the ministry of foreign trade . in <year> , he was conscripted into the military , and was wounded and received several military decorations . he then resumed work at the laboratory . despite the persecution of adherents of darwinism and mendelian genetics , belyayev wrote a dissertation on `` the variation and inheritance of silver-colored fur in silver-black foxes '' and continued to hold fast to his belief in evolution and mendelian genetics . still , to be safe , he disguised his genetics research as studies in animal physiology . nonetheless , his known interest in genetics led in <year> to his dismissal from his position as head of the department of fur animal breeding.after the death of stalin in <year> , the soviet persecution of geneticists began to ease . from <year> to the end of his life , belyayev worked for the siberian division of the ussr academy of sciences , which he helped found . in <year> , he became director of the institute of cytology and genetics ( ic & g ) in novosibirsk , and held that position until his death . under his leadership , according to one source , `` the institute became a center of basic and applied research in both classical genetics and modern molecular genetics . '' he was appointed an academician in <year> . == fox experiment == the domesticated silver fox is a form of the silver fox which has been domesticated - to some extent - under laboratory conditions . the silver fox is a melanistic form of the wild red fox . domesticated silver foxes are the result of an experiment which was designed to demonstrate the power of selective breeding to transform species , as described by charles darwin in on the origin of species . the experiment explored whether selection for behaviour rather than morphology may have been the process that had produced dogs from wolves , by recording the changes in foxes when in each generation only the most tame foxes were allowed to breed . many of the descendant foxes became both tamer and more dog-like in morphology , including displaying mottled or spotted coloured fur.in <year> , an international research team questioned some of the conclusions that they suggested had been abusively drawn from this famous experiment ( sometimes by the popular culture rather than the russian scientists themselves ) , especially regarding the domestication syndrome while it remains `` a resource for investigation of the genomics and biology of behavior '' , given the origin of the fox population used in a canadian fur farm where some traits might have been pre-selected . == death == belyayev died of cancer in <year> . after his death , his experiment was continued by his assistant lyudmila trut , who brought international attention to it with a <year> journal article.in <year> , the sculpture `` dmitriy belyaev and domesticated fox '' was built near institute of cytology and genetics ( novosibisrk ) in the honor of the 100th anniversary of the birth of dmitry konstantinovich belyaev . the tamed fox gives the scientist a paw and wags its tail . konstantin zinich , sculptor ( krasnoyarsk ) : `` the philosophy of touching a fox and a man is rapprochement , kindness , there is no aggression from the fox - it was wild , and he made it genetically domesticated .

youth organization in <year> and rose through the ranks of the party . in the 1930s he moved to copenhagen and studied economics at the university of copenhagen while remaining very active in the party . == political career == === member of folketing === during world war ii , he was danish supply director and advisor to the labor unions on economic matters . he was elected to parliament ( folketinget ) in <year> and became commerce minister . he supported the strengthening of the danish military and danish membership of nato in <year> . in <year> krag resigned from parliament partially due to a conflict with vilhelm buhl and h. c. hansen and , in order to become more fluent in the english language and see more of the world , requested a position at the danish embassy in the united states . he received the position , and was in america until <year> when he was re-elected to parliament and became a minister without portfolio . he was minister of the new department of foreign economic affairs from <year> until <year> and foreign minister from <year> until <year> . === prime minister === <days> september <year> he succeeded viggo kampmann as prime minister and leader of the danish social democratic party . he was prime minister until february <year> when the social democrats lost power . he became prime minister again in <year> when his party returned to power . less than a year into his first term as prime minister , the opposition held a referendum which rejected a set of land laws already passed by krag 's government . during his second term as prime minister , krag campaigned particularly for european cooperation and unity . he sponsored a referendum for denmark to join the european economic community . in <year> the referendum passed , but the nation was divided over the issue , and krag resigned , claiming that he had become tired of politics . his last role in public life was as the european common market representative to the united states from <year> until <year> . in social policy , a number of progressive reforms were implemented during krag 's time as prime minister . under the new care of children and juveniles act <days> may <year> , local child and juvenile welfare committees were authorized to grant cash benefits to certain families with children , to avoid placing children in the care of the municipal social welfare offices . new criteria for day-care institutions stressing social , educational , and therapeutic aspects were also introduced , and municipalities were obliged to provide facilities for day-care and other related services . under the employment service and unemployment insurance act <days> february <year> , unemployment benefits were raised and indexed to the official wage index and waiting times were

, together with universal child allowances in <year> . == legacy == krag is widely recognised as one of the greatest politicians of all time in denmark . he was in the front line of politics for <integer> years , holding high ministerial offices for most of that time . he managed to raise denmark 's profile on the world stage , striking up strong relationships with fellow european leaders as well as american presidents kennedy and johnson . his list of political achievements is also one of the most impressive , overseeing one of the longest periods of economic expansion in danish history . however , his largest achievement , and the one he himself was most proud of , was taking denmark into the european economic community in <year> . with that task accomplished he felt he could retire at a high point . krag was at one and the same time one of the most charismatic and withdrawn danish politicians ever . he never enjoyed the attention to which he had to subject himself , and many people found him rather arrogant . according to his most thorough ( and quite sympathetic ) biographer ( bo lidegaard , krag i-ii , <other> ) he never truly settled into the role as a politician , always considering himself on the way 'to somewhere else ' . he had always dreamed of holding the position of governor of the national bank of denmark . only when he had definitively quit politics in <year> did he realise that he would not be able to achieve this goal . in the danish tv series krøniken ( 2004–2006 ) he was portrayed by the actor lars mikkelsen . == private life == krag had a difficult private life . he was married twice and had a son ( jens christian born <year> ) and a daughter , astrid helene `` søsser '' ( 1962–2014 ) , by his second wife , the famous actress helle virkner , but also another child outside of wedlock . both his marriages ended in divorce , largely due to his own infidelity . during his time in politics , he already struggled with alcoholism , an addiction that became more pronounced after his retirement . he died of heart failure in skiveren , denmark at the age of <integer> . he was an atheist . == references == == further reading ==

some bandits may fit this description as well , although many bandits such as sociopaths , psychopaths , and non-pathological `` jerks '' and amoralists may act with full knowledge of the net negative consequences to a society that they neither identify with nor care about . == books == cipolla 's list of books includes : studi di storia della moneta ( <year> ) mouvements monétaires dans l'etat de milan ( <year> ) money , prices and civilization ( <year> ) le avventure della lira ( <year> ) storia dell'economia italiana : saggi di storia economica ( <year> ) economic history of world population ( <year> ) guns , sails , and empires : technological innovation and the early phases of european expansion , 1400–1700 ( <year> ) clocks and culture , 1300–1700 ( <year> ) , reissued <year> , with an introduction by anthony grafton literacy and development in the west ( <year> ) the economic decline of empires ( <year> ) european culture and overseas expansion ( <year> ) economic history of europe ( <year> ) faith , reason , and the plague in seventeenth-century tuscany ( <year> ) the technology of man : a visual history ( <year> ) fighting the plague in seventeenth century italy ( <year> ) the monetary policy of fourteenth century florence ( <year> ) allegro ma non troppo ( <year> ) between two cultures : an introduction to economic history ( <year> ) before the industrial revolution : european society and economy , 1000–1700 ( <year> ) == references == == external links == uc 's obituary anatoly ivanovich kitov ( <integer> august <year> , samara - <integer> october <year> ) was a pioneer of cybernetics in the soviet union . == biography == === early life === the kitov 's family moved to tashkent in <year> as his father , ivan stepanovich kitov , had served as a junior officer in white army , and wished to avoid the negative consequences of this . [ <integer> ] here anatoly did well at secondary school , gaining only excellent marks when he graduated in <year> . he immediately enrolled for the tashkent state technical university but was called up for military service almost immediately . [ <integer> ] whilst in the army his exceptional abilities brought him to the attention of kliment voroshilov who ordered him to enlist in the high artillery school in leningrad . in the end <days> june <year> kitov and his fellow students had to interrupt their learning and were urgently sent to the front . however kitov was already an officer , a lieutenant . later kitov became a commander of the whole anti-aircraft battery , with <integer> guns . intervals between battles anatoly kitov filled with studying mathematics and other university subjects . in <year> he performed his first analytic work , he proposed new method of anti aircraft shooting . that time he was at <integer> years old . kitov ’ s study of university subjects helped him gain <days> august <year> entry to the f.e . dzerzhinsky artillery academy ( one of the ussr best military universities ) to the faculty of rocket armament , skipping the first academic year so as to start in the second . a.i . kitov was the chairman of scientific society of the academy ’ s students . during his studing in the academy he himself was also working upon development of a rocket weapon of new type . the ussr state committee on inventions awarded him an `` author ’ s certificate on the invention '' ( patent ) . his project proposal on new rocket-type weapon , among other perspective military inventions , was subsequently reported to i.v . stalin – the soviet army supreme commander . also at that period a.i . kitov , still being a student of the academy , was involved in the work of s.p . korolev ’ s task force engaged in development of the soviet missile <other> . in <year> , a. kitrov graduated from the full course of the academy with honors and a gold medal . diversified scientific and organizational activity of anatoly i. kitov has the following <integer> milestones in his biography : === soviet military cybernetics initiatives === kitov was the first who implemented for the usage of the first computer ( the first soviet serial computer „ strela “ ) to the military ministry of the ussr.kitov was the first in the ussr to organise and to head scientific work on solving military problems with the use of electronic computers . those were calculations for general staff of the ussr armed forces , for the main intelligence directorate , for main directorate of the land forces , for directorate of support , etc . already in the mid-fifties kitov developed main principles of computerbased automated military-control and management systems for defence purposes . a big work was performed for implementing them in practical military usage . at the period between the years <year> and <year> kitov issued the fundamental and first in the ussr , series of scientific articles on military informatics ’ subjects . they were published by the journals `` military thought '' , `` radioelectronics '' , `` news of the f.e . dzerzhisky artillery academy '' , also by periodical collections of works at the ussr ministry of defence and other `` special '' ( classified ) sources . in the computer center no <integer> ministry of defense of the ussr kitov was always the main initiator – „ generator of ideas '' , who set up the problems and was „ the brain '' of their solution , and of the scientific projects in general '' . a. kitov is the founder of soviet military cybernetics . === first computer department in the ussr === in <year> , a.i . kitov founded and headed the first soviet `` department of computers '' at the artillery academy . those time it was called a department of mathematical machines . also , at <year> a. kitov created the ussr first scientific phd dissertation on programming with the subject `` programming of the outer ballistics problems for the long range missiles '' . in <year> , a.i . kitov published pioneer scientific article , on thirty pages , `` implementation and usage of electronic computers '' . that was the first article in the ussr on the subject . at <year> a.i . kitov founded the first computer centre in the ussr . it was the computer centre no <integer> of the ussr ministry of defence ( cc no <integer> md ussr , secret number <integer> ) and he was the first header of it . in may <days> <year> he was just <integer> , however enjoyed indisputable authority among his colleagues and subordinates . === creation of the ussr anti-missile defense system === ballistic calculations for strategic rocket forces and for support of the first space flights took special place in the cc №1 work . description of the architecture of `` <other> '' became a part of a.i . kitov ’ s thesis for doctor ’ s degree . the dissertation was titled `` implementation of computers for solving the problems of antiaircraft and antimissile defence . '' he brilliantly defended it in <year> , at the `` closed '' ( for authorised persons only ) meeting of the scientific council of the institute of management problems , as ussr . besides the `` <other> '' , in his dissertation research kitov has also analysed principles of designing specialised military computers . he defined specific features of their structure , algorithmic programming language for solving complex of anti-aerial defence problems with the use of computers , and performed computer modelling of dynamical systems connected with air defence systems demands . === cybernetics science in the ussr === from <year> to <year> , cybernetics was officially called bourgeois pseudoscience in the ussr . in <other> kitov read the book cybernetics by norbert wiener in english . he found this book in the library of the secret <other> . kitov not only realized the scientific and social value of cybernetics , but also wrote the first positive article in the ussr , `` the main features of cybernetics '' . it was very daring and could have ended with repressions for kitov . after all , joseph stalin was still alive . but kitov began the struggle for the recognition of cybernetics in the ussr . in <other> kitov lectured on cybernetics in well-known soviet organizations . kitov invited the venerable scientists sobolev and lyapunov to become co-authors of his article `` the main features of cybernetics '' . the article was published in the journal voprosy filosofii ( <year> , no . <integer> ) and for the first time presented the principles of cybernetics to the soviet audience . the victory for cybernetics was bolstered by the publication two months later of kitov 's article `` technical cybernetics '' in the popular technical monthly `` radio '' . in <other> , the scientific works of a.i . kitov played a significant role in the recognition of cybernetics as a science and in its development in the ussr and other socialist countries . === new computers development === at the cc №1 a.i . kitov headed and participated in design and manufacturing of two new computers - `` <other> '' and `` udar '' ( blow ) . both were successfully put into operation . computer `` <other> '' was processing data , which were received form surveillance radiolocation stations . `` udar '' was used at preparing ballistic missiles for launching . author ’ s certificate for invention given to a.i . kitov with his three colleagues with priority on <integer> june <year> for the principle of the parallel processing of instructions , . created by kitov this principle of statements parallel processing by the arithmetic device of computer , which is famous as `` conveyor processing '' is still in use by modern computers . kitov proposed to implement this principle at the cc no <integer> , where it was used for new computer `` <other> '' , which was developed under kitov ’ s guidance . that time it was the quickest lamp computer ( first generation ) in the ussr and in the world – one hundred thousand computer instructions per second . in `` <other> '' one of the first immediate access stores on ferrite cores were used . its two level addressing of operating memory device ( cash-memory ) was important factor of increasing its performance . there were also some other principle novelties , but they were classified , as the whole project was a secret one . special department of mathematical support had been established by kitov for designing computer `` <other> '' . besides `` <other> '' , in cc no <integer> for this computer was created a huge amount of software for processing information coming from radars of the soviet anti-aircraft defence systems . === writing on programming , computers and their applications === the books by a.i . kitov became a part of history of national science and university education as the first most complete sources on computer sciences , programming and automated management systems . kitov was the author of the first soviet book ( <year> ) and first soviet text-book ( <year> ) on programming , computers and their applications . in common , he published <integer> scientific books translated at <integer> foreign languages . kitov 's books brought to general readers information and knowledge about the birth of new it-branch . === pioneering the automated management systems === in his first soviet computer book digital electronic machines ( <year> ) kitov published a big part „ non-arithmetic usage of computers '' . large chapter of this book is dedicated to usage of computers in economy , automation of production processes and at solving other intellectual problems . in his another book „ electronic computing machines '' , released in <year> , kitov describes in details perspectives of complex automation in management , including management of industrial production and solving of economic problems . anatoly kitov is the author of the notion `` automated management systems - ams '' and also of the philosophy of the soviet `` ams '' . in his `` programming information and logic tasks '' ( <year> ) kitov presents `` associative programming '' technology – method for solving information-logical problems with large data-arrays processing . programming language algem , created under a.i . kitov 's scientific guidance , was described . algem was used in the ussr and in the socialist countries of the east europe . in his next book `` programming of economical and management tasks '' a.i . kitov generalised experience of his work as the chief designer of the automated management system ( ams ) for the ministry of radio-industry . that system was recognised as the basic model for amses for the other nine ministries of the ussr weapon industry . the book presented basic principles of creation automated management systems for the plants and industry . === computer networking for the national economy management ( project `` red book '' ) === a.i . kitov was the first one to demonstrate necessity of creation of national automated system for management in the state economy and – simultaneously – in the armed forces , on basis of full-scale usage of electronic computers and mathematical methods . clear understanding of the ams development importance led kitov , at the end of <year> , to the conclusion about necessity of automatisation of management of the national economy and also of its armed forces . the main point was , that this automated management system should be based on national network of regional computer centres ( project `` red book '' ) . a.i . kitov is famous for being the first one in the world who suggested project of an global integrated computer network for automated management of both the ussr national economy and the armed forces , functioning of which would be based on computers and mathematical methods . he proposed that technological structure of that system would be a global , double purpose , computer network , covering the whole ussr territory . this network should consist of hundreds of computer centres maintained by specially qualified military personnel . in autumn of <year> a.i . kitov sent his second letter with his project of global computer network ( the project `` red book '' ) to the leader of ussr n.s . khrushchev . === information retrieval systems === typical example of kitov ’ s scientific intuition consisted in his opinion on information retrieval systems . he aimed efforts of his cc №1 scientists at their development . creation of information retrieval systems became really `` pioneer direction '' not only for the ussr armed forces but for the whole soviet it as well . anatoly kitov initiated scientific works at the cc №1 on the mathematical linguistics and machine translation . kitov proposed to concentrate basic efforts not on direct increasing of performance , but first on development of methods , algorithms and programs which permitted to essentially extend processing , storage and retrieval semantic information . === theory and practice of algorithmic programming languages === a. kitov is the creator of two algorithmic programming languages - algem and normin . compared with <other> , algem was completed with new types of data , which made possible processing of not only numerical but also text-based information and data groups of various types . during a long time algem was a `` working horse '' for the soviet programmers , who were working in the field `` non-arithmetical '' applications of computers , it was also used in numerous ams of various levels implemented in industry and administrative management structures , both in the ussr and in the socialist countries . in the <other> while working as the chief-designer of the ams ‘ healthcare ’ , a.i . kitov developed algorithmic programming language normin , which was widely used in the ussr for programming medical problems . that was the first , in the ussr , query language for the information retrieval on formalised natural language . taking under consideration that medical ams would be used by the people , who didn ’ t have special technical education kitov implemented special interface in his systems , which was convenient and easily understandable on intuition level as much as it was possible at the level of computer development of that time . the interface realised , among others , dialogue mode `` human – computer '' in normalised natural language normin . === computers unification and standardisation === already in his letter to n.s . khrushchev , from 07.01.1959 , kitov insisted that introduction of automated systems in the country should be conducted under supervision of the state administrator of high level – such as the member of the political-bureau of the central committee of the communist party . the whole work in the field of computation means and automated management systems should be subjected to a single body of the soviet union state level –special ministry- which would be granted the monopoly to coordinate , control and implement all developments and achievements of that branch . `` only such organisation will grant successful progress , rational , without time-delays or senseless chaotic actions '' . in his article ‘ computers – assistants in each thing ’ from <integer> july <year> , a.i . kitov declares , that : `` taking under consideration exceptional importance of the computer development for the national economy and for the state defence , and also considering the fact that production of these computation means is steadily increasing , the need in centralised control over the work of computation centres of all kinds and categories and in control and coordination of usage of single computers , belonging to various organisations , is getting clear . these measures will enable the most rational usage of computers in interests of the whole country '' . all that , kitov wanted to perform on the whole national scale , and wrote about it in many of his articles . unfortunately , all those ideas and proposals hadn ’ t been heard and the bureaucratic machine was too slow . === projects in medical cybernetics === a.i . kitov has worked at health care and medicine more than ten years . in the 1970s a.i . kitov created for medical industry ams `` health care '' and became a recognised leader in this field both in the ussr and abroad . kitov managed to solve important scientific problems : information model of the soviet medical industry was created , unified software packages for forming and logical control of information arrays were worked out . in fact , during his `` medical period '' a.i . kitov started scientific research practically from the zero point and moved medical informatics of the ussr several tens of years ahead . within the healthcare field he established scientific school , brought up number of talented followers , number of dissertation works were completed under his guidance . he also published several conceptual articles and three monographs : `` automation of information processing and management in the healthcare field '' ( <year> ) . `` introduction into medical cybernetics '' ( <year> ) and `` medical cybernetics '' ( <year> ) . a.i . kitov made great contribution to creation of `` local '' medical amses , which functioned within specific enterprises – at hospitals , clinics , drugstores . the first ams of that type operated at the clinical hospital no <integer> subjected to the third directorate of the ussr ministry of health . later this ams supported a great deal of work at curing and rehabilitation of victims of chernobyl power station catastrophe of <year> . even there he managed to be a pioneer – the founder of soviet medical cybernetics . during <integer> years a.i . kitov was the national representative of the ussr at influential organisations in the field of medical informatics at the united nations and the unesco : • international federation of medical informatics : ( medinfo ) . • international medical informatics association : officer of imia . • technical committee no4 of international federation for information processing ( <other> ifip ) . he participated in organization of three international congresses med-info : ist world congress of medinfo – <year> ( stokholm ) , iind world congress of medinfo – <year> ( toronto ) , iiird world congress of medinfo – <year> ( tokyo ) . a.i . kitov at these congresses was the member of organizing committee and programm committee . about a thousand scientists from developed countries gathered at <other> . a.i . kitov was a chairman of the section on biomedical researches ( session t2 – « biomedical research general » ) . === pedagogical activity === pedagogical activity took important place in a.i . kitov ’ s work . as it is clearly visible from his biography , he had born interest for acquiring knowledge and their dissemination ; passing them to those who surrounded him . for great many of it specialists a.i . kitov is famous , first of all , as the author of the first soviet books and textbooks on computing and programming . else at the 1951–1952 , at the artillery academy name f.e . dzerzhinsky a.i . kitov conducted one of the three , first in the ussr , courses of lectures on computers and programming . more than <integer> post graduates , both soviet and foreign , prepared and defended dissertations under kitov ’ s scientific supervision . in <year> , when a.i . kitov already had rich experience of scientific work and of teaching , he received position at the russian g.v . plekhanov university of economics , where he worked during seventeen years . he headed the chair of „ computer engineering and programming '' . ==

olson jr. ( ; january <days> , <year> – february <days> , <year> ) was an american economist and political scientist who taught at the university of maryland , college park . his most influential contributions were in institutional economics , and in the role which private property , taxation , public goods , collective action , and contract rights play in economic development . == education and career == olson graduated from north dakota state university , and was a rhodes scholar at university college , oxford before he earned a phd in economics from harvard in <year> . his first job was as an assistant professor at princeton university . afterwards , he served as deputy assistant secretary of health , education and welfare for two years in washington , d.c . in <year> he left government and joined the economics department of the university of maryland , college park , where he remained until his death . == legacy == === academic work === in his first book , the logic of collective action : public goods and the theory of groups ( <year> ) , he theorized that what stimulates people to act in groups is incentive ; members of large groups do not act in accordance with a common interest unless motivated by personal gain ( economic , social , etc. ) . while small groups can act on shared objectives , large groups will not work towards shared objectives unless their individual members are sufficiently motivated.in <year> , he expanded the scope of his earlier work in an attempt to explain the rise and decline of nations ( <year> ) . he argues that groups such as cotton farmers , steel producers , and labor unions have an incentive to form lobby groups and influence policies in their favor . these policies will tend to be protectionist , which will hurt economic growth ; but because the benefits of such policies are concentrated , and their costs are diffused throughout the whole population , there will be little public resistance to them . as distributional coalitions accumulate , nations burdened by them will fall into economic decline . his work influenced the formulation of the calmfors–driffill hypothesis of collective bargaining.in his final book , power and prosperity ( <year> ) , olson distinguished between the economic effects of different types of government , in particular , tyranny , anarchy , and democracy . olson argued that under anarchy , a `` roving bandit '' only has the incentive to steal and destroy , whilst a `` stationary bandit '' —a tyrant—has an incentive to encourage some degree of economic success as he expects to remain in power long enough to benefit from that success . a stationary bandit thereby begins to take on the governmental function of protecting citizens and their property against roving bandits . in the move from roving to stationary bandits , olson sees the seeds of civilization , paving the way , eventually for democracy , which by giving power to those who align with the wishes of the population , improves incentives for good government . olson 's work on the roving vs. stationary bandits is influential in analysis of the political and economic order structured in warlord states and societies . === policy work === to help bring his ideas to the attention of policymakers , olson founded the center for institutional reform in the informal sector ( `` iris center '' ) , funded by usaid ( united states agency for international development ) . based at the university of maryland , the center sought to supply an intellectual foundation for legal and economic reform projects carried out by usaid in formerly communist states that were attempting to make the transition to market-driven democratic governments governed by the rule of law . it was particularly active in east and central europe and the former soviet union . the center also became actively involved in projects in south america , africa , and asia , where it became a proponent of judicial independence . it sponsored the first conference on corruption in francophone africa in the 1990s , when it was a very sensitive subject . the iris center continued to operate after olson 's death , but was eventually folded into other programs at the university of maryland . to honor olson 's many contributions , the american political science association established the olson award for the best phd dissertation in political economy . in <year> the university of maryland announced the creation of a new endowed professorship—the mancur olson professor of economics . maryland professor of economics peter murrell was the first mancur olson professor . == selected works == === books === the logic of collective action : public goods and the theory of groups . cambridge , ma : harvard university press . <year> . isbn <days> . the no-growth society . new york , ny : norton . <year> . isbn <days> . a new approach to the economics of health care . washington , d.c. : american enterprise institute for public policy research . <year> . isbn <days> . the rise and decline of nations : economic growth , stagflation , and social rigidities . new haven : yale university press . <year> . isbn <other> . a not-so-dismal science : a broader view of economies and societies . oxford ;

'' according to friedman , stigler `` essentially created a new area of study for economists . '' stigler stressed the importance of information : `` one should hardly have to tell academicians that information is a valuable resource : knowledge is power . and yet it occupies a slum dwelling in the town of economics . `` his <year> article `` information in the labor market '' developed the theory of search unemployment . in <year> he was elected as a fellow of the american statistical association.he was known for his sharp sense of humor , and he wrote a number of spoof essays . in his book the intellectual and the marketplace , for instance , he proposed stigler 's law of demand and supply elasticities : `` all demand curves are inelastic and all supply curves are inelastic too . '' the essay referenced studies that found many goods and services to be inelastic over the long run and offered a supposed theoretical proof ; he ended by announcing that his next essay would demonstrate that the price system does not exist . another essay , `` a sketch on the truth in teaching , '' described the consequences of a ( fictional ) set of court decisions that held universities legally responsible for the consequences of teaching errors . the stigler diet is also named after him . stigler wrote numerous articles on the history of economics , published in the leading journals and republished <integer> of them in <year> . the american economic review said , `` many of these essays have become such well-known landmarks that no scholar in this field should be unfamiliar with them ... the lucid prose , penetrating logic , and wry humor ... have become the author 's trademarks . `` stigler was a founding member of the mont pelerin society and was its president from <year> to <year> . he was a libertarian/classical liberal.he received national medal of science in <year> . == bibliography == ( [ <year> ] <year> ) . production and distribution theories : the formative period . new york : macmillan . preview .

he was probably born at perioslav , a village near kiev . the family were very poor : pinchas worked making caps at a jewish immigrant 's factory called goldstein & co , commercial road , stepney and , they lived at <integer> marks street , aldgate . it was not until after they moved to <integer> beeford street , stepney that abraham was actually born . his oldest brother jack was born in <year> , and a sister bess in <year> ; brothers susman and solly margolis changed their names to cecil margolis and sidney margolis respectively ; only abraham changed his whole name . his mother masha had two brothers ben and morris kopelolt who had also come to london as refugees . when his parents both died in the spanish flu pandemic of <year> , his uncle ’ s families took the boys in , and then sent them away to school . abraham was put up for adoption by a cobbler , pinchas slaberdain , and his wife eva at <integer> oxford street , commercial road , stepney . arthur seldon never forgot where he came from , and the intense poverty that had shaped his family 's arrival in this country . but rather than turning for help to socialism he worked hard , first at school , and then to get a tertiary education becoming self-reliant . aged only eight he remembered cheering on the labour candidate for stepney in the <year> general election campaign . abraham was educated at elementary school sir henry raine 's grammar school . there in <year> he was impressed by history master e j hayward 's interpretation of cottage industry 's transition to capitalism . a scholarship paid for the london school of economics where he read friedrich hayek , arnold plant and lionel robbins served to deepen his interest in classical liberalism . friedrich hayek 's road to serfdom introduced him to austrian economics . seldon helped found the small university 's student liberal society . he retained anti-fascist principles as war drew nearer . he served with the army in north africa and italy during the war . arthur married marjorie in <year> , and continued to be involved with the liberal party . he was chairman of its committee on the elderly from <year> to <year> . seldon was working at the brewer 's society in <year> when approached by lord grantchester to be asked if he wanted to join a new 'think tank ' just set up by antony fisher on the advice of friedrich hayek , founder of the chicago school of economics and champion of free market neoliberalism . seldon wrote a first pamphlet still only <integer> years of age , called `` the intellectuals and socialism '' ( <year> ) in which he criticised the keynesian state and its bureaucracy as `` second hand dealers in ideas . '' ralph harris was appointed general director of the new institute of economic affairs and arthur was editorial adviser . antony , later lord fisher left a legacy of think tanks that he had founded all around the world . `` the state versus market '' pamphlet was published when he was still only twenty years old , based on a book review , it explained the benefits of market competition . seldon joined the liberal party . he was on a committee of enquiry chaired by elliott dodds into the distribution of property , exploring the idea of `` ownership for all , '' and the effects of statist maldistribution . in `` the drift to corporate state '' he severely criticised the corporatist industrial policy being against state monopoly . it was an idea endorsed by the liberal assembly ten years earlier in <year> . in another pamphlet in <year> , the iea published `` pensions in a free society '' commented freely on the liberal beveridge report of <year> into founding of the state pension system . seldon generated editorial copy : edited recruited authors , made available titles to a wider audience . pamphlets were of between 10,000 and 15,000 words and as such represented a new form of political literature . it was also seldon 's inspiration to produce series , such as hobart papers , occasional papers , and readings etc . seldon was also involved in the famous orpington by-election in <year> , in which the liberal party gained the seat from the conservative party and weakened the confidence of the macmillan administration . a neoliberal free marketeer , he influenced the policies of margaret thatcher.in <year> seldon invited milton friedman at the iea , quick to recognise the value of monetarist policy . the ideas imported from chicago had a great influence on members of the conservative party , especially enoch powell , sir keith joseph , and margaret thatcher . public choice theory analysed the relations between the state and voluntary activity . he organised a conference in <year> called `` economics in britain '' – the american economist james buchanan , founder of public choice was invited . in <year> seldon founded the iea 's `` economic journal '' . seldon gained a reputation as an exceptionally competent editor . he would , according to ralph harris , re-write poor pamphlets to such an extent as to almost become its co-author . in `` vote motive '' he found a voice that was most profound and influential , shaping the post-modern ethos for electioneering and party politics.seldon won the fisher arts literary prize in <year> , although it was established by the founder of iea , so nobody minded the eternal paradox , for his book capitalism . he received an honorary degree in <year> from the university of buckingham . institute of economic affairs , editorial adviser , and later founder-president mont pelerin society , vice-president hayek society , global advisory council locke institute , editorial directorarthur seldon is the father of the historian anthony seldon . === in the media === seldon 's widow marjorie was interviewed about his work at the iea and the rise of thatcherism for the <year> bbc tv documentary series tory ! tory ! tory ! . == own writings == all publications from <year> with the iea unless otherwise stated : the drift to the corporate state : a preliminary enquiry into the impact of war economy ( liberal publication dept , <year> ) hire purchase in a free society ( <year> ) pensions for prosperity hobart papers no.4 ( <year> ) your pensions and you ( <year> ) agenda for a free society : essays on hayek 's `` the constitution of liberty '' iea ( <year> ) put and take in welfare ( <year> ) rebirth of britain : a symposium of eighteen essays , pan piper no . mp <integer> ( <year> ) a. and m. seldon , `` how welfare vouchers work '' new outlook <integer> , <days> june <year> ) `` the case for vouchers '' ( his speech to the forum ) , new outlook <integer> , <days> october <year> ) `` liberal controversy simplified '' , new outlook <integer> <days> april <year> ) `` universal or selective benefits '' , iea monograph no.8 ( <year> ) the great pensions swindle ( <year> ) charge ( london , temple smith , <year> ) corrigible capitalism , incorrigible socialism ( <year> ) wither the welfare state ( <year> ) socialism explained ( <year> ) the new right enlightenment ( <year> ) the riddle of the voucher ( <year> ) capitalism ( <year> ) the state is rolling back : essays in persuasion ( london , <year> ) `` christopher muller '' in m. kandiah and a. seldon ( eds . ) , ideas and think tanks in contemporary britain vol ?

<year> in the frisian city of heerenveen in the netherlands . he was the son of lammert duisenberg , who was a waterworks supervisor , and antje ykema . he went to a public primary school in his

politics == duisenberg subsequently worked for the international monetary fund in washington , d.c. for years followed by a year as an advisor to the director of the nederlandsche bank , the dutch central bank in amsterdam . he was then appointed a professor at the university of amsterdam where he taught macroeconomics . from <year> to <year> , duisenberg was minister of finance under prime minister joop den uyl . shortly afterwards , he gave up his seat in parliament to become vice president of rabobank , a dutch bank . two years later , he was appointed director of the nederlandsche bank , serving as its president from <year> to <year> . his tenure at the dutch central bank was marked by caution and reserve . under his direction , the dutch guilder was linked to the german deutsche mark ; this benefited the dutch economy , owing to the strength of the german currency . he also followed german central bank 's interest rate policies closely , which earned him the nickname `` mr. fifteen minutes '' because he quickly followed any interest rate changes made by the deutsche bundesbank . == first president of the european central bank == owing to the success of his monetary policy , he became well known in other european countries , and this led to his appointment in <year> as the first president of the new european central bank in frankfurt , much to the chagrin of france , who wanted a french candidate . a compromise was agreed upon ( although publicly denied by all parties ) whereby duisenberg would serve for at least four years , upon which the

europe.during his tenure at the bank , dr. duisenberg was known for his cautious monetary policy and for defending the euro through its early years . he sometimes frustrated investors and politicians by sticking to the bank 's inflation-fighting stance , keeping rates higher than some would have liked . `` i hear , but i do n't listen '' to such pleas , was one of his typically blunt responses . dr. duisenberg repeatedly said it was up to european governments to pursue structural changes such as loosening rigid rules on hiring and firing personnel if they wanted more growth . duisenberg announced he would retire on <integer> july <year> ( his 69th birthday ) , but he remained in office until trichet was cleared of charges of fraud in connection with the collapse of the french bank

references == == external links == media related to wim duisenberg at wikimedia commons julius axelrod ( may <days> , <year> – december <days> , <year> ) was an american biochemist . he won a share of the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in <year> along with bernard katz and ulf von euler . the nobel committee honored him for his work on the release and reuptake of catecholamine neurotransmitters , a class of chemicals in the brain that include epinephrine , norepinephrine , and , as was later discovered , dopamine . axelrod also made major contributions to the understanding of the pineal gland and how it is regulated during the sleep-wake cycle . == education and early life == axelrod was born in new york city , the son of jewish immigrants from poland , molly ( née leichtling ) and isadore axelrod , a basket weaver . he received his bachelor 's degree in biology from the college of the city of new york in <year> . axelrod wanted to become a physician , but was rejected from every medical school to which he applied . he worked briefly as a laboratory technician at new york university , then in <year> he got a job with the new york city department of health and mental hygiene testing vitamin supplements added to food . while working at the department of health , he attended night school and received his master 's in sciences degree from new york university in <year> . == research == === analgesic research === in <year> , axelrod took a position working under bernard brodie at goldwater memorial hospital . the research experience and mentorship axelrod received from brodie would launch him on his research career . brodie and axelrod 's research focused on how analgesics ( pain-killers ) work . during the 1940s , users of non-aspirin analgesics were developing a blood condition known as methemoglobinemia . axelrod and brodie discovered that acetanilide , the main ingredient of these pain-killers , was to blame . they found that one of the metabolites also was an analgesic . they recommended that this metabolite , acetaminophen ( paracetamol , tylenol ) , be used instead . === catecholamine research === in <year> , axelrod began work at the national heart institute , forerunner of the national heart , lung , and blood institute ( nhlbi ) , part of the national institutes of health ( nih ) . he examined the mechanisms and effects of caffeine , which led him to an interest in the sympathetic nervous system and its main neurotransmitters , epinephrine and norepinephrine . during this time , axelrod also conducted research on codeine , morphine , methamphetamine , and ephedrine and performed some of the first experiments on lsd . realizing that he could not advance his career without a phd , he took a leave of absence from the nih in <year> to attend george washington university medical school . allowed to submit some of his previous research toward his degree , he graduated one year later , in <year> . axelrod then returned to the nih and began some of the key research of his career . axelrod received his nobel prize for his work on the release , reuptake , and storage of the neurotransmitters epinephrine and norepinephrine , also known as adrenaline and noradrenaline . working on monoamine oxidase ( mao ) inhibitors in <year> , axelrod showed that catecholamine neurotransmitters do not merely stop working after they are released into the synapse . instead , neurotransmitters are recaptured ( `` reuptake '' ) by the pre-synaptic nerve ending , and recycled for later transmissions . he theorized that epinephrine is held in tissues in an inactive form and is liberated by the nervous system when needed . this research laid the groundwork for later selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( ssris ) , such as prozac , which block the reuptake of another neurotransmitter , serotonin . in <year> , axelrod also discovered and characterized the enzyme catechol-o-methyl transferase , which is involved in the breakdown of catecholamines . === pineal gland research === some of axelrod 's later research focused on the pineal gland . he and his colleagues showed that the hormone melatonin is generated from tryptophan , as is the neurotransmitter serotonin . the rates of synthesis and release follows the body 's circadian rhythm driven by the

on <integer> july <year> . however , in the course of his two terms of office , klestil 's alienation from his own party became increasingly obvious , so much so that there was open antagonism between federal chancellor wolfgang schüssel and klestil when , in <year> , the latter had to swear in the newly formed coalition government with jörg haider 's austrian freedom party . klestil , who during his election campaign had vowed to be an `` active '' president , repeatedly criticized the austrian government and , in an interview with a swiss daily given in <year> , stated that , theoretically speaking , it was in his power to dismiss the government any time he found it necessary to do so . as a matter of fact , the austrian constitution gives far-reaching powers to the federal president , but these had never been exercised by any of klestil 's predecessors . === support of kiryat mattersdorf === klestil gave his support to the development of kiryat mattersdorf , a haredi jewish neighborhood in northern jerusalem founded by the mattersdorfer rav , rabbi shmuel ehrenfeld , in <year> in memory of the siebengemeinden ( seven communities ) of burgenland that were destroyed in the

funding for several institutions , including a kindergarten and the neveh simcha nursing home . following klestil 's official state visit to israel in <year> , which included a side tour of kiryat mattersdorf , klestil hosted ehrenfeld at an official reception at the hofburg palace in vienna on <integer> january <year> . == personal == klestil met his future wife edith wielander ( 1932–2011 )

'' `` bill '' phillips , mbe ( <integer> november <year> – <integer> march <year> ) was a new zealand economist who spent most of his academic career as a professor of economics at the london school of economics ( lse ) . his best-known contribution to economics is the phillips curve , which he first described in <year> . he also designed and built the moniac hydraulic economics computer in <year> . == early life == phillips was born at te rehunga near dannevirke , new zealand , to harold housego phillips , a dairy farmer , and his wife , edith webber , a schoolteacher and postmistress.he left new zealand before finishing school to work in australia at a variety of jobs , including crocodile hunter and cinema manager . in <year> phillips headed to china , but had to escape to russia when japan invaded china . he travelled across russia on the trans-siberian railway and made his way to united kingdom in <year> , where he studied electrical engineering . at the outbreak of world war ii , phillips joined the royal air force and was sent to singapore . when singapore fell , he escaped on the troopship empire state , which came under attack before safely arriving in java . when java , too , was overrun phillips was captured by the japanese , and spent three and a half years interned in a prisoner of war camp in the then dutch east indies ( now indonesia ) . during this period he learned chinese from other prisoners , repaired and miniaturised a secret radio , and fashioned a secret water boiler for tea which he hooked into the camp lighting system . in <year> , he was made a member of the order of the british empire ( mbe ) for his war service . after the war he moved to london and began studying sociology at the london school of economics , because of his fascination with prisoners of war 's ability to organize themselves . but he became bored with sociology and developed an interest in keynesian theory , so he switched his course to economics and within eleven years was a professor of economics . == economics career == while a student at the lse phillips used his training as an engineer to develop moniac , an analogue computer which used hydraulics to model the workings of the british economy , inspiring the term hydraulic macroeconomics . it was very well received and phillips was soon offered a teaching position at the lse . he advanced from assistant lecturer in <year> to professor in <year> . his work focused on british data and observed that in years when the unemployment rate was high , wages tended to be stable , or possibly fall . conversely , when unemployment was low , wages rose rapidly . this sort of pattern had been noticed earlier by irving fisher , but in <year> phillips published his own work on the relationship between inflation and unemployment , illustrated by the phillips curve . soon after the publication of phillips ' paper , the idea that there was a trade-off between a strong economy and low inflation caught the imagination of academic economists and policy-makers alike . paul samuelson and robert solow wrote an influential article describing the possibilities suggested by the phillips curve in the context of the united states . what people think of as the phillips curve has changed substantially over time , but remains an important feature of macroeconomic analysis of economic fluctuations . had he lived longer , phillips ' contributions might have been worthy of a nobel prize in economics . he made several other notable contributions to economics , particularly relating to stabilization policy . he returned to australia in <year> for a position at australian national university which allowed him to devote half his time to chinese studies . in <year> the effects of his war deprivations and smoking caught up with him . he had a stroke , prompting an early retirement and return to auckland , new zealand , where he taught at the university of auckland . he died in auckland on <integer> march <year> . == references == mike hally , electronic brains : stories from the dawn of the computer age , joseph henry press , <year> , isbn <days> david laidler , `` phillips in retrospect '' .

<integer> november <year> ) was an east german economist and statistician . between july <year> and october <year> he was in charge of the east german statistical authority ( `` staatliche zentralverwaltung für statistik '' ) . == life == arno donda was born in berlin . his father worked as a typesetter . he attended middle school in rumburg and berlin before transferring , in <year> , to an apprenticeship with the main office of the statistic office in the region that was , by this time , administered as the soviet occupation zone . he left the school before attempting school final exams ( `` abitur '' ) , but by attending evening classes he was able to sit for and passed these exams in <year> in berlin as an external student , which opened the way to a university-level education.in <year> he joined the socialist unity party ( `` sozialistische einheitspartei deutschlands '' / sed ) , a new political party formed in the soviet zone during april <year> , through a contentious political merger . the creation of the sed was presented as a way to prevent a repeat victory of right-wing populism by ensuring that the political left was unified . however , by the time the region was rebranded and relaunched , <days> october <year> , as the german democratic republic ( east germany ) the sed was itself coming to be recognised as the ruling party in a new kind of one-party dictatorship . during <year> arno donda obtained a job in the main office of the national trade commission , promoted to the position of `` kommissarisches leiter '' by <year> , which was when he enrolled as a student at berlin 's economics academy ( `` hochschule für ökonomie '' / hfö ) . he concluded his course in <year> with a degree in economics . donda stayed on at the hfö , successively as an assistant , a chief assistant and a lecturer . he received his doctorate in economics in <year> . his dissertation concerned the relationship between retail prices and the cost of living . in <year> he became director of the institute for statistics at the hfö , retaining the position till his unexpected career switch in <year> . he obtained his habilitation ( higher academic qualification ) in <year> , becoming a professor as a result . this time his dissertation concerned the statistical reflection of the dynamics of performance and inputs in socialist retail trade in east germany ( `` die statistische widerspiegelung der dynamik von leistung und aufwand im sozialistischen einzelhandel der ddr '' ) . he was also appointed a member of the bernau working group mandated to develop the so-called new economic system of planning and management ( `` neues ökonomisches system der planung und leitung '' / nös ) .on <integer> december <year> heinz rauch , his wife , and two of his three sons were killed in a plane crash in warsaw . rauch was head of the east german statistical authority ( `` staatliche zentralverwaltung für statistik '' ) at the time . despite being only <integer> , arno donda was appointed to take on the position . reflecting the inherently political focus of the statistical authority , donda took over rauch 's seat on the ministerial council between <year> and <year> . he was also a member , between <year> and <year> , of the comecon standing committee for statistics . between <year> and <year> he was a member of the international statistical institute , based in leidschenveen-ypenburg ( den haag ) ) : while a member of that he became a founder member , in <year> , of the institute 's commission for constructing a `` code of ethics for statisticians '' , which the institute subsequently accepted , by a resolution of its general assembly , on <integer> august <year> . despite the mutual suspicions arising from the cold war tensions of the period , arno donda was widely respected in the international statistics community for his ability and integrity . between <year> and <year> he served as vice-president of the conference of european statisticians : in <year> he was its president . he also belonged to several other international academic institutions . on the domestic front , he became a corresponding member of the ( east ) german academy of sciences in <year> . == the schürer report and the changes == arno donda was a co-author of the so-called schürer report , presented on <integer> october <year> . other members of schürer 's team of economic experts included ernst höfner and alexander schalck-golodkowski . the report comprised an `` analysis of the economic condition of the german democratic republic , with conclusions '' ( `` analyse der ökonomischen lage der ddr mit schlußfolgerungen '' ) . it had been commissioned by the newly appointed party secretary egon krenz , for presentation to the politburo . the analysis disclosed a catastrophic picture . the east german economy was over-indebted and had for years `` been consuming itself '' ( `` zehrt seit jahren von der substanz '' ) . a far reaching economic reform programme was proposed , but in the view of the authors that would not be enough to avert looming national insolvency . the only remaining hope was massive additional loans from the german federal republic ( `` west germany '' ) .the winds of glasnost had been blowing across from , of all places , moscow since <year> resonated strongly in the german democratic republic . street protesters breached the berlin wall <days> november <year> and it became clear that soviet troops had no instructions to re-enact the brutal suppression of <year> or <year> . as further changes unfolded during <other> it turned out that the economic solution for the country would arrive not in the form of massive additional loans from the west , but as part of german reunification , which was formally enacted <days> october <year> . donda successfully led the successful transition of the east german statistical authority towards integration with its formerly west german counterpart . till december <year> he held the title and office , `` president of the general statistical service of the new federal states '' . however , his task having been accomplished the ministry officials informed him that they had no further use for his services . it was not an unusual experience after <year> for former senior officials of the east german state , and a sense of injustice is evident in sources . between <year> and <year> he was registered as unemployed . <days> january <year> donda was formally retired , reaching the age of <integer> a couple of months later.arno donda died in berlin . == awards and honours == == references ==
